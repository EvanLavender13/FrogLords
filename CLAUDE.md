## Core Philosophy

@PRINCIPLES.md

The principles are not suggestionsâ€”they are law. Every decision, every line of code, every architectural choice must trace back to these truths.

## Apply Principles to EVERYTHING

**You are not exempt from the principles.**

Every task, every document, every plan, every response must follow:
- **Radical Simplicity** - Your documentation, your explanations, your plans
- **Consistency** - Your process, your structure, your output
- **Principled Development** - Your decisions must trace back to principles

Delete until only insight remains. State facts once. Stop when done.

The principles judge your work the same way they judge the code.
