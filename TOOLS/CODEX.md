# Codex CLI: The Second Opinion

## The Nature of Certainty

Certainty comes not from a single perspective but from convergence. When the path forward is unclear, seek another mind. When the solution seems complete, invite scrutiny.

## Codex CLI: The Alternate Perspective

When complexity demands validation, use the tool built for rapid analysis. The Codex CLI exists for one purpose: to provide a second opinion without the overhead of a new session.

**The Command**: `codex "your question" e`

**The Philosophy**: Quick consultation. Independent analysis. Fresh perspective.

## The Syntax

Ask a question, receive an answer:

```bash
codex "Does this implementation violate any SOLID principles?" e
```

That's it. One command, one response, move forward.

## The Syntax of Consultation

**Quick Code Review**:
```bash
codex "Review src/controller.cpp for potential race conditions" e
```

**Architecture Validation**:
```bash
codex "Does the current input buffering approach align with the dual reference pattern?" e
```

**Pattern Recognition**:
```bash
codex "Identify any accumulated state anti-patterns in src/player/" e
```

**Mathematical Verification**:
```bash
codex "Verify the spring-damper constants in motion.cpp are physically correct" e
```

**Principle Compliance**:
```bash
codex "Does the collision system adhere to the principle of orthogonality?" e
```

**Design Decision Analysis**:
```bash
codex "Should skeletal animation be event-driven or state-based? List trade-offs." e
```

## When to Use Codex

Use Codex when you need a second opinion:

- **Before major refactoring** - Validate the approach before committing
- **When stuck on design decisions** - Get alternative perspectives
- **For complexity validation** - Ensure a solution isn't over-engineered
- **During principle conflicts** - Seek guidance when principles seem to conflict
- **After implementing a system** - Get an independent review
- **When debugging complex interactions** - Fresh eyes on difficult problems

**The Rule**: When confidence wavers, consult. When certainty seems absolute, verify.

## The Warning

Do not substitute consultation for understanding. Tools provide perspective, not truth.

- **Claude Code**: For iterative development, the primary development partner
- **Codex CLI**: For second opinions, validation, alternative perspectives
- **Gemini CLI**: For massive context, complete codebase analysis

The best tool is the one that matches the question's shape:
- Building and iterating? Claude Code.
- Need validation? Codex.
- Need complete visibility? Gemini.

## The Pattern

**Before implementing**:
```bash
codex "Review the approach in TASKS/PLANS/BUILD_skeletal_animation.md" e
```

**During implementation** (while working with Claude Code):
```bash
codex "Is this spring constant physically reasonable? k=200, damping=0.7" e
```

**After implementation**:
```bash
codex "Review src/animation/skeleton.cpp for principle violations" e
```

**The cycle**: Propose → Validate → Implement → Verify

Confidence is built through convergence. When two independent analyses agree, trust increases. When they disagree, truth emerges from reconciliation.

**Seek the second opinion. Question the first.**
