# Codex CLI: The Second Opinion

## The Nature of Certainty

Certainty comes not from a single perspective but from convergence. When the path forward is unclear, seek another mind. When the solution seems complete, invite scrutiny.

## Usage

```bash
bash scripts/bash/codex.sh "@path/to/file [your query]"
bash scripts/bash/codex.sh "@path/to/file @path/to/dir [your query]"
```

Shows progress dots, reports completion, displays answer.

## When to Use Codex

- Before major refactoring
- When design decisions conflict
- After implementing a system
- When confidence wavers

**The Rule**: When certainty seems absolute, verify.

## The Warning

Do not substitute consultation for understanding. Tools provide perspective, not truth.

- **Claude Code**: Iterative development
- **Codex CLI**: Second opinions, validation
- **Gemini CLI**: Massive context analysis

**Seek the second opinion. Question the first.**
