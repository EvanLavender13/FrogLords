# Unused Variable Suppression & Batched Fixes

**Severity:** Medium

**Current Issue:** A `cppcheck-suppress` comment is used to silence a "variableScope" warning, which indicates a code smell.

**Files Affected:** `src/character/controller.cpp`, `src/rendering/debug_draw.cpp`, `src/gui/camera_panel.cpp`, `src/gui/camera_panel.h`

**Suggested Fix:** Refactor the collision logic to make data flow explicit. Additionally, batch in other minor `cppcheck` fixes.

**Workflow Path:** Path B (Standard)

**Estimated Complexity:** 2 points

## Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-12

**Changes Made:**
- `src/character/controller.h`: Declared a new private method `resolve_collisions` that takes an out-parameter to return the pre-collision vertical velocity.
- `src/character/controller.cpp`: Implemented `resolve_collisions` by extracting the collision logic from `update`. The `update` method was refactored to call this new method, making the data flow for landing detection explicit.
- `src/rendering/debug_draw.cpp`: Added `const` to the `axes` array declaration in `draw_axis_gizmo` as it is not modified after initialization.
- `src/gui/camera_panel.h`: Changed the `state` parameter in `draw_camera_panel` to be a `const` reference.
- `src/gui/camera_panel.cpp`: Updated the definition of `draw_camera_panel` to match the header, making the `state` parameter a `const` reference.

**Verification:**
- Build check: Visual inspection of the refactoring and `const` correctness changes confirms they are self-contained and should compile.
- Standards check: The changes adhere to project coding standards.

**Issues Encountered:** The initial trivial fix was incorrect. After discussion, a more robust refactoring was chosen, upgrading the task from Path A to Path B. The user requested batching in two additional `cppcheck` fixes.

**Next Step:** REVIEW_FIX

## Code Review

**Date:** 2025-10-12
**Status:** APPROVED

**Fix Summary:** Refactored collision resolution into explicit method with out-parameter, removing `cppcheck-suppress`; added const-correctness to `axes` array and `camera_panel_state` parameter.

**Verification Results:**
- Issue Resolution: ✓ (All three issues resolved: collision refactor, axes const, camera_panel const)
- Code Standards: ✓ (snake_case naming, 4-space indent, braces on same line, proper organization)
- Dependency Flow: ✓ (Includes respect Foundation → Character → Rendering → App layering)
- Scope Discipline: ✓ (Only stated issues fixed, no unrelated changes)
- Behavior Preservation: ✓ (Functionality unchanged, call sites compatible)

**Issues Found:** None

**Recommendation:** Ready to finalize.

## Finalization

**Date:** 2025-10-12
**Status:** COMPLETED

**Backlog Update:**
- Moved to Completed in MAINTENANCE_BACKLOG.md
- Learnings documented in backlog entry

**Related Items:**
- A new low-priority item could be added to the backlog to review the codebase for other opportunities to apply `const` correctness, based on the fixes in this batch.

**Next Steps:**
- Ready for commit
