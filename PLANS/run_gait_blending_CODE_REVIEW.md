# Code Review: Run Gait Blending

**Date:** 2025-10-13 (Second Review)
**Status:** APPROVED

### Summary

Implementation approved after detailed second review. Code adheres to all development principles, maintains clean dependency flow, and implements bilinear slerp exactly as planned. Naming conventions (snake_case) and formatting (4-space indent, braces on same line) are consistent. Gameplay-first principles respected—no control latency introduced, animation remains pure reactive layer. Implementation is clear, simple, and reuses proven patterns. Debug UI provides excellent iteration velocity with blend mode isolation and telemetry. All checklist items complete, build/lint/format verified clean.

### Violations (Must Fix)

**If none:** No violations found.

### Suggestions (Consider)

**If none:** Implementation looks solid.

### Code Quality Checks

- [x] Naming: snake_case
- [x] Formatting: 4-space indent, braces on same line
- [x] Dependency flow respected
- [x] Gameplay-first principles (input→acceleration, interruptible, physics-first)
- [x] Simplicity over sophistication

### Detailed Analysis

**File: src/character/animation.h (lines 69-71)**
- Signature change correctly adds `walk_factor` parameter as planned
- Maintains existing parameters, preserving backward compatibility with manual override path
- Clean interface, no coupling to locomotion internals

**File: src/character/animation.cpp (lines 123-245)**
- Bilinear slerp implementation matches pseudocode exactly (lines 206-211)
- Three-pass blending: horizontal walk blend, horizontal run blend, vertical walk/run blend
- Contact weight gating applied correctly (line 210): `slerp(t_pose, gait_blend, contact_weight)`
- Manual override fast-path preserved (lines 126-129)
- Segment mapping clean and readable (lines 143-175)
- Root transform preservation pattern maintained (lines 194, 240)
- Lambda helpers (`apply_blended_joint`, `blend_channel`) improve readability without sacrificing clarity
- No quaternion hemisphere issues—relies on `glm::slerp` shortest-path behavior
- Display pose logic (line 243) provides useful GUI feedback

**File: src/character/locomotion.h (line 36)**
- Added `get_run_blend() const` as planned
- Encapsulates blend computation, single source of truth

**File: src/character/locomotion.cpp (lines 65-72)**
- `get_run_blend()` implementation clean and correct
- Matches game_world's prior inline calculation—preserves behavior
- Clamps to [0, 1] range properly
- Handles edge case (threshold_span <= 0) gracefully

**File: src/gui/character_panel.h (lines 20-21)**
- `blend_mode` enum added for debug isolation
- Clean state structure, no gameplay coupling

**File: src/gui/character_panel.cpp (lines 192-204, 285-295)**
- Debug UI section provides blend mode override (Walk Only, Mixed, Run Only)
- Telemetry displays both locomotion-computed and applied walk_factor
- `compute_walk_factor_override()` implements debug override cleanly
- Contact weight display valuable for tuning

**File: src/app/game_world.h (lines 31-32)**
- `smoothed_walk_factor` and `walk_factor_smoothing` added for exponential smoothing
- Dual-reference pattern correctly applied (instant target, smoothed state)

**File: src/app/game_world.cpp (lines 87-91, 106)**
- Walk factor computation uses `locomotion.get_run_blend()` (single source)
- Exponential smoothing applied before debug override (correct order)
- Parameter passed to `update_skeletal_animation()` as planned
- Clean integration, no code duplication

**Architecture Validation:**
- No system duplication detected
- Skeleton ownership remains in `game_world.t_pose_skeleton` (single instance)
- Animation state correctly lives in `controller.animation`
- Locomotion provides blend factor via minimal API (`get_run_blend()`)
- Debug UI remains pure reactive layer—zero gameplay coupling
- Dependency flow respected: Foundation → Character → Rendering → App

**Gameplay-First Principles:**
- Input maps to acceleration (unchanged by this feature)
- Animation remains reactive—physics-first controller unaffected
- Interruptibility preserved (manual override fast-path intact)
- No control latency introduced (blending is instantaneous computation)
- No reactive layer overriding core logic (animation follows physics state)

**Pattern Reuse:**
- Surveyor wheel distance-phased triggering (existing)
- Quaternion slerp with hemisphere safety (`glm::slerp`)
- Dual-reference smoothing pattern (walk_factor follows acceleration tilt, landing spring, contact weight)
- Debug UI telemetry and override pattern (consistent with prior iterations)
- Root transform preservation (established in skeletal animation stack)

**Scope Verification:**
- Line count: ~60 lines in animation.cpp (within estimate of 40-60)
- Additional ~15 lines in locomotion.cpp (getter)
- Additional ~20 lines in game_world.cpp/h (smoothing + integration)
- Additional ~15 lines in character_panel.cpp/h (debug UI)
- Total: ~110 lines across 4 subsystems—matches 3-point complexity estimate
- No content authored (reuses existing run keyframes)
- No architectural changes beyond minimal API addition

### Actionable Items

**If none:** Ready to proceed with finalization.

### Recommendation

**Reasoning:** Implementation demonstrates exemplary adherence to principles and plan. Code is clear, simple, and maintains all architectural boundaries. Bilinear slerp correctly implements 2D blend space as specified. Debug tooling enables rapid iteration. No violations, no suggestions for improvement. Build/lint/format verified clean. All quality gates passed.

Specific strengths:
- Clean separation of concerns (locomotion computes blend, animation applies, game_world orchestrates)
- Dual-reference smoothing pattern correctly applied
- Debug UI provides excellent observability (blend mode isolation, telemetry)
- Manual override path preserved (no regression risk)
- Contact weight gating integrates seamlessly
- No quaternion hemisphere issues (proven slerp infrastructure)
- Lambda helpers improve readability without complexity

Pattern validation:
- Proves 2D bilinear slerp architecture for future multi-axis blending
- Validates walk_factor smoothing approach (dual-reference pattern)
- Confirms distance-phased surveyor wheel scales to complex blending

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed to FINALIZE_FEATURE
- Consider updating NOTES/pose_blending_explained.md per feature post-implementation note (capture actual implementation details, tuning values, lessons learned)
