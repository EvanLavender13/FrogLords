# Iteration Plan: Static Keyframe Preview

### 1. Feature Overview

*   **Description:** Manual GUI selection between hardcoded skeletal poses to validate quaternion-based keyframe data structure before adding locomotion integration.
*   **Core Principle Alignment:** 
    - **Iteration over planning:** Validates fundamental keyframe architecture through minimal working implementation before tackling locomotion-driven animation
    - **Simplicity over sophistication:** Hardcoded poses + manual selection only; no blending, no locomotion phase, no authoring UI
    - **Graybox before polish:** Proves quaternion storage/composition works with minimal scope; visual validation is the test
    - **Dependencies first:** Bottom-up approach—fixes architectural flaw from failed primary skeletal animation attempt (single-float keyframes insufficient for 3D rotation)

### 2. Design Rationale

*   **Problem/Goal:** Previous primary skeletal animation attempt failed due to fundamental data structure limitation—single float per joint cannot represent arbitrary 3D rotations. Need to validate quaternion-based keyframe system works correctly before re-attempting locomotion integration.
*   **Hypothesis:** If we can manually select between 4 hardcoded poses (REACH-RIGHT, PASS-LEFT, REACH-LEFT, PASS-RIGHT) and see them display correctly on the skeleton without visual artifacts, then the quaternion keyframe data structure is sound and ready for locomotion-driven animation playback.

### 3. Dependencies & Uncertainty

*   **Placement in Stack:** Reactive Animation Layer (above Skeleton Debug System, below future Primary Skeletal Animation)
    - **Direct Dependencies:** 
        - Skeleton Debug System ✅ (100% certain)
        - Attach Skeleton to Body ✅ (100% certain)
        - GUI system ✅ (100% certain)
    - **What Depends On This:** 
        - Primary Skeletal Animation (locomotion-driven) - currently deferred at ~10% certainty
        - Secondary Motion - currently deferred at ~15% certainty
        - IK systems - backlog
*   **Certainty Score:** 70% (Medium-High)
    - **Justification:** Reduced scope from failed implementation. Quaternion math is well-understood (glm provides it). Risk is in correct composition with T-pose baseline and ensuring visual output matches intent. No novel systems—just proving data structure works.
    - **Cascading Uncertainty:** Low. Failure here means rethinking rotation representation entirely (Euler angles fallback), but won't cascade upward—skeleton debug system remains stable, controller/locomotion unchanged.

### 4. Implementation & Testing Loop

*   **Graybox Scope (The "Stupid Simple Core"):**
    
    1. **Upgrade keyframe data structure** (1-2 hours)
        - Define `struct keyframe` with quaternion rotations per joint
        - 8 joints only: `left_shoulder`, `right_shoulder`, `left_elbow`, `right_elbow`, `left_hip`, `right_hip`, `left_knee`, `right_knee`
        - Hardcode 3 walking poses (STEP_LEFT, NEUTRAL, STEP_RIGHT) derived from walk gait reference images
    
    2. **Apply keyframe to skeleton** (1-2 hours)
        - Write `apply_pose(skeleton& skel, pose_type pose)` function
        - Compose quaternion rotations with T-pose baseline local transforms
        - Apply to joint indices: 5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15 (shoulders, elbows, hips, knees)
        - Convert quaternion to 4x4 matrix: `glm::mat4_cast(quat)`
        - Call `update_global_transforms()` to propagate hierarchy
    
    3. **GUI pose selection** (30 minutes)
        - Add dropdown to Character Panel
        - Enum: `T_POSE, STEP_LEFT, NEUTRAL, STEP_RIGHT`
        - On selection change, call `apply_pose()` with selected pose
        - No interpolation—instant snap between poses
    
    **Key Parameters to Expose:**
    - Pose selection (dropdown: T_POSE, STEP_LEFT, NEUTRAL, STEP_RIGHT)
    
    **Physics-First / Interruptibility:**
    - N/A—purely visual system, no gameplay interaction
    - Pose application happens after physics, before render (same timing as existing animation systems)
    
*   **Testing Protocol:**
    - **Self-test:** Switch between all 4 poses (T_POSE, STEP_LEFT, NEUTRAL, STEP_RIGHT) rapidly. Look for:
        - Visual artifacts (inverted joints, broken hierarchy, gimbal lock)
        - Limbs pointing in expected directions per pose intent
        - Smooth composition with T-pose baseline (no pops or snaps in bone positions)
    - **Over-the-shoulder (optional):** Show tester the dropdown, ask "what's happening when you change this?" See if poses are visually distinct and readable.
    - **Sample size:** 1-2 testers sufficient (simple visual validation, not gameplay feel)
    - **Metrics:** None needed—binary pass/fail (poses look correct or don't)
    
*   **Success Metrics (Definition of "Proven"):**
    - Selected pose displays correctly on skeleton without visual glitches
    - Quaternion composition with T-pose baseline produces expected limb positions (compare to reference images of walk cycles)
    - GUI switching between poses is instant and stable (no crashes, no flicker)
    - Code is simple and reusable (<150 lines total for keyframe struct + apply function + GUI)
    
*   **Iteration Cadence & Horizon:**
    - **First loop:** 2.5-3.5 hours (Steps 1-3: data structure + application + GUI)
    - **Tuning loop:** 1-2 hours (adjust hardcoded quaternion values until poses look right)
    - **Total horizon:** 1 day maximum
    - **Criteria for extension:** If quaternion math is unfamiliar, may need extra hour for research/experimentation
    - **Criteria for shortening:** If glm quaternion API is straightforward and poses work first try, could finish in 2-3 hours

### 5. System Integration

*   **System Ownership:**
    - **Current State:**
        - `skeleton`: Lives in `game_world.t_pose_skeleton` (single instance)
        - GUI: `character_panel` already has "Skeleton" section with show/animate toggles
    - **No Conflicts:** Skeleton remains in `game_world`; keyframe application happens in `game_world::update()` based on GUI state (same pattern as existing animation systems)
    - **Integration Point:** Add `selected_pose` to `gui::character_panel_state`, read in `game_world::update()`, apply before skeleton debug draw
    
*   **Mechanic Interactions:**
    - **Zero gameplay interaction:** Purely visual/debugging tool at this stage
    - **Emergence potential:** Once locomotion-driven animation works, this manual selection becomes obsolete (or kept as debug/authoring tool)
    - **No overlap:** Distinct from acceleration tilt (reactive layer) and landing spring (reactive layer)—this is authored animation data, not physics-driven
    
*   **Interface & Feedback:**
    - **Metaphor:** Film animator's pose library—select named poses from a list
    - **Visual hierarchy:** Dropdown in existing "Skeleton" GUI section (low noise, optional feature)
    - **Redundancy:** Pose name in dropdown + visual skeleton = two signals for current state
    - **Graybox feedback:** No audio; visual is skeleton rendering itself (already proven in debug system)

### 6. Risks & Future Work

*   **Potential Risks:**
    - **Quaternion composition errors:** Incorrect multiply order or missing T-pose baseline could produce inverted/broken limbs. Mitigation: Test one joint at a time; compare against glm documentation examples.
    - **Gimbal lock / visual artifacts:** Quaternions avoid gimbal lock, but incorrect Euler-to-quat conversion could introduce issues. Mitigation: Use glm's built-in conversion functions; validate with simple 90° rotations first.
    - **Hardcoded pose authoring difficulty:** Tuning quaternions by hand is tedious. Mitigation: Accept rough poses for validation; perfect poses not required (graybox principle). Use edit-rebuild workflow (adjust angles in `keyframe.cpp`, rebuild, test). Only add real-time tuning UI if edit-rebuild becomes intolerable after multiple cycles.

*   **Scope Change Decision (Added During Implementation):**
    - **What Changed:** Joint override UI system was added in first iteration (before testing edit-rebuild workflow).
    - **Rationale:** Real-time joint manipulation provides **invaluable learning tool** for building physical, intuitive understanding of 3D rotation in hierarchical skeletons. The immediate visual feedback accelerates learning curve for spatial reasoning (Euler angles → quaternions → visual result). This knowledge has high reuse value across all future animation work.
    - **Alignment with Principles:** While this appears to violate "wait for third use," it aligns with **"Knowledge Creation > Implementation"** (AGENTS.md). The UI is a knowledge-creation tool, not premature optimization. The cost was low (~1 hour), risk was zero (easily removable), and the learning value justified the deviation from strict graybox scope.
    - **Outcome:** UI proved immediately useful for pose tuning and will remain as authoring tool for future animation development. This was the correct decision.
    
*   **Content Restrictions:**
    - **None.** Feature is purely additive to existing skeleton system. No constraints on level design, character scale, or future animation work.
    
*   **Decision Impacts (Checklist):**
    - **Implementation cost:** Low (2.5-3.5 hours, <150 lines of code)
    - **Immaturity burden:** Low (self-contained system; failure doesn't block other work)
    - **Critical failure risk:** Very low (worst case: delete feature, keep skeleton debug system intact)
    - **Process burden:** None (solo project, no coordination needed)
    - **Political/cultural effects:** N/A
    - **Decision cost:** Low (straightforward validation step with clear success/fail criteria)
    
*   **Backlog Candidates:**
    - **Real-time keyframe tuning UI:** Add Euler angle sliders for per-joint rotation adjustment with instant visual feedback. Defer until edit-rebuild workflow proves intolerable (wait for third rebuild cycle minimum). If added, use to find correct angles, then hardcode back into `keyframe.cpp` and remove UI (graybox tooling only).
    - **Pose interpolation:** Linear blend between two keyframes (validates blending math before adding locomotion phase). Very low priority—locomotion-driven system will need this, but not for static preview.
    - **Pose library system:** Save/load poses from JSON files instead of hardcoding. Defer until authoring workflow solidifies (premature optimization).
    - **Full-body IK:** Automatic foot placement, hand reaching. Far future—needs terrain complexity first (current flat ground doesn't demand it).

## Next Steps After Validation

If this iteration succeeds (poses display correctly):
1. **Re-approach Primary Skeletal Animation** with proven quaternion keyframe foundation
2. Add locomotion phase integration (surveyor wheel distance → keyframe selection)
3. Add pose interpolation (blend between keyframes based on phase)
4. Validate arm swing cycles sync with walk/run speeds

If this iteration fails (quaternions don't work as expected):
1. Investigate Euler angle representation as fallback
2. Re-evaluate whether full skeletal animation is necessary (current animation systems feel good; arm swing may not add sufficient value)
3. Consider deferring skeletal animation entirely and focusing on higher-value features (gameplay abilities, world interaction)
