# Magic Number in Easing Update

**Severity:** Medium

**Current Issue:** A hardcoded `max_speed` value of `8.0f` is used in the legacy `update()` method in `src/character/animation.cpp`. This should be replaced with a named constant or passed in as a parameter.

**Files Affected:** `src/character/animation.cpp`

**Suggested Fix:** Pass `max_speed` as a parameter to the `update()` method.

**Workflow Path:** Path B (Standard)

**Estimated Complexity:** 1
