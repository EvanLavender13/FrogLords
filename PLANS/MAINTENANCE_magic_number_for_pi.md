# Magic Number for PI

**Severity:** Low

**Current Issue:** The file `src/rendering/debug_draw.cpp` uses the literal `3.14159f` for PI in several places, which is inconsistent with the rest of the project that uses `glm::pi<float>()`.

**Files Affected:** `src/rendering/debug_draw.cpp`

**Suggested Fix:** Replace all instances of `3.14159f` with `glm::pi<float>()` to ensure consistency and maintainability.

**Workflow Path:** Path A (Trivial)

**Estimated Complexity:** 1 point
