# Design Backlog

**A liquid pool of unordered ideas. Pull only when foundation is certain.**

## The Rule

Ideas remain here until:
1. The foundation below them is 90%+ certain
2. They serve a clear gameplay need (not speculation)
3. They can be validated in isolation
4. They embody radical simplicity

## Foundation Repairs (Next Priority)

### Verify Yaw Sign Convention

---

## Removed Systems (Learn From)

### What Failed (2025-10-16)
- **Acceleration Tilt:** Coordinate confusion, sign errors
- **Contact Springs:** Complexity without purpose
- **Locomotion System:** Over-engineered for current needs
- **Walk/Run Blending:** Unnecessary state multiplication

### Why They Failed
Not because the ideas were bad, but because:
1. Mathematical foundation wasn't validated
2. Complexity preceded necessity
3. Couldn't debug what couldn't be seen
4. Built on assumptions, not verified truth

### Lessons
These may return when:
- Debug visualization exists
- Mathematical foundations are proven
- Simpler versions prove insufficient
- Never before

## Frog Concepts üê∏

**Pure speculation, kept for inspiration:**

Tongue grapple, hop charging, sticky surfaces, water advantages, fly catching, inflation mechanics, egg spawning, croak communication, metamorphosis, lily pads.

**Certainty:** ~0%. Most will never exist.

---

## Selection Criteria

Before pulling from backlog, ask:

1. **Does it serve immediate gameplay?** (Not hypothetical future gameplay)
2. **Can it be validated in isolation?** (Test before integration)
3. **Is it the simplest solution?** (Complexity must justify itself)
4. **Are its dependencies certain?** (Don't build on sand)
5. **Can we explain why it exists?** (Purpose must be clear)

If any answer is "no," leave it in the pool.

---

## The Discipline

This backlog is deliberately:
- **Unordered:** No false priorities (except critical fixes)
- **Liquid:** Ideas can merge, split, die
- **Mostly wrong:** Most ideas won't survive contact with reality
- **Always growing:** Capture everything, build almost nothing

The backlog is not a todo list. It is a pool of possibilities waiting for the right foundation.

**Update when:** Ideas emerge, items pulled, systems removed, lessons learned.

**Never:** Create dependencies between backlog items. Plan beyond the foundation's certainty.
