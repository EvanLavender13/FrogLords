# Principle Review: Character Axis Gizmo

**Date:** 2025-10-12
**Status:** APPROVED

### Summary

The plan for the `character_axis_gizmo` is exceptionally well-aligned with established development principles. It proposes a simple, high-value debug visualization that directly addresses a known friction point (confusion around rotation axes) identified in previous work. The implementation is a straightforward extension of existing, stable debug rendering systems, making it low-risk and high-certainty. The scope is minimal and focused, and all planning documents are consistent.

### Violations (Must Fix)

**NOTE:** Categorize for retrospectives (Premature Polish | Missing Prerequisites | Scope Creep | Reactive Control | System Duplication | Other)

No violations found.

### Misalignments & Risks

Plans appear well-aligned.

### Actionable Items

Ready to proceed with implementation.

### Recommendation

**Reasoning:** The feature is a low-risk, high-reward debug tool that will immediately improve the efficiency and accuracy of all future animation and pose-tuning work. The plan is clear, correct, and adheres to all project principles.

**Next Steps:**
- If APPROVED: Proceed to IMPLEMENTATION_STEP
- If REVISE: Address items, re-review
- If DEFER: Update DESIGN_BACKLOG with findings
