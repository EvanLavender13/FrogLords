# Simplify Velocity Clamping

**Severity/Priority:** Medium

**Current Issue:** Two blocks of code in `src/character/controller.cpp` extract, modify, and then reassign the horizontal velocity. This is repetitive and can be simplified.

**Files Affected:**
- `src/character/controller.cpp`

**Proposed Fix:** Create a local helper function `clamp_horizontal_speed(glm::vec3&, float)` to encapsulate the logic of clamping the horizontal speed.

**Rationale:** This change improves code quality by reducing duplication and making the code more readable and maintainable, following the principle of "Clarity over cleverness; simplicity over sophistication" from AGENTS.md.

**Workflow Path:** Path A (Trivial)

**Estimated Complexity:** 2 points

**Risk Level:** Low - This is a simple, localized change with no behavior modification.

**Tags:** #simplification #controller

## EXECUTION (Trivial Path)

**Executed:** 2025-10-13 22:30 UTC

### Changes Made

**File:** `src/character/controller.cpp`
- Added a new helper function `clamp_horizontal_speed` in an anonymous namespace.
- Replaced the friction and speed cap logic in `update` function with calls to the new helper function.

### Verification

- [x] Build succeeds
- [x] clang-format passed
- [x] clang-tidy clean
- [x] No new warnings

### Notes

The change was successful and the code is now more readable and maintainable.

### Changes Summary

**Files Modified:**
- `src/character/controller.cpp` - Created a local helper function `clamp_horizontal_speed` to reduce code duplication in the `update` function.

**Impact:**
Reduced code duplication and improved readability and maintainability of the `update` function.

### Backlog Updates

**Item Status:** Moved to Completed in IMPROVE_BACKLOG.md

**New Items Discovered:**
- None.

**Batch Opportunities Noted:**
- None.

### Learnings

**What Worked Well:**
- Identifying and extracting duplicated code into a helper function was straightforward.
- The "Trivial Path" workflow is well-suited for this kind of refactoring.

**What Was Harder Than Expected:**
- Nothing.

**Insights for Future Work:**
- Regularly look for opportunities to reduce code duplication, even in small ways.

**Time Estimate Accuracy:**
- Estimated: 2 points / ~10 minutes
- Actual: 2 points / ~10 minutes
- Variance: Accurate
