## Pattern Analysis

### Feature Iterations

#### Planning Phase

**Strong Pattern: Certainty scores increasingly accurate**
- Camera zoom: 95% predicted → completed without deferral ✓
- Debug visual overhaul: 60% predicted → completed smoothly (underestimated by 40 points)
- Pose blending: 85% predicted → completed with minor investigation (hemisphere correction) ✓
- Smoothed walk transition: 60% predicted → completed without issue (underestimated by 40 points)
- Velocity tilt scaling: 85% predicted → completed exactly as planned ✓
- **Learning:** Certainty calibration improving over time; pattern reuse and stable infrastructure justify 80-95% scores

**Strong Pattern: Problem evidence requirement enforced**
- All 5 features had documented problem evidence before selection
- Camera zoom: User request during animation iteration + specific observation need
- Debug visuals: Playtest observation (speed circle artifact) + expressive tool philosophy
- Pose blending: Documented discrete switching pops with code line references
- Walk transition: User observation + existing violation of input→acceleration principle
- Tilt scaling: Playtest observation (walk lean misleading) with specific speed values
- **Learning:** Retrospective 1 improvement (problem evidence check) working perfectly

**Strong Pattern: Simple features completing in single session**
- Camera zoom: 90 min (vs 30-60 estimate), but stayed single session
- Debug visuals: Single day with healthy iteration loops
- Velocity tilt scaling: ~30 min, exactly as estimated
- **Observation:** Features 15-50 lines with 95%+ certainty consistently finish same-day

**Emerging Pattern: Certainty underestimation for debug/tool features**
- Debug visual overhaul: Predicted 60%, actual smooth completion → 40 points too pessimistic
- Smoothed walk transition: Predicted 60%, actual smooth completion → 40 points too pessimistic
- **Root cause:** Both built on proven infrastructure (debug_draw, controller) with clear integration points
- **Learning:** Debug tools and parameter exposure on stable systems deserve 80-90% certainty

#### Implementation Phase

**Exceptional Pattern: Organic scope evolution creating value**
- Camera zoom: Core feature (18 lines) → discovered bug fix (5 lines) → user-requested GUI (75 lines) → architectural improvement (unified panel)
  - Scope increased 30→90 min, but all additions were debug tools (zero gameplay risk)
  - Unified Debug Panel architecture now reusable for future panels
  - User involvement during implementation caught one-frame delay bug early
- **Learning:** Scope growth acceptable when: (1) debug/iteration tools only, (2) same session, (3) architectural improvements discovered

**Strong Pattern: Bug discovery during implementation revealing deeper insights**
- Camera zoom: One-frame delay in FOLLOW mode → identified mode-specific update pattern difference
- Pose blending: Hemisphere flipping → researched GDC transcripts, validated dot product math
- Walk transition: Circular dependency (max_speed referencing itself) → discovered need for dual-reference pattern
- **Learning:** Bugs caught through testing often reveal architectural patterns worth documenting

**Exceptional Pattern: Healthy iteration loops with immediate feedback**
- Debug visuals: 1.0s→0.1s trail sampling discovered through observation
- Debug visuals: Static→dynamic ring expansion improved visual feedback
- Walk transition: Default 10.0 transition rate worked immediately (no extended tuning)
- **Learning:** Real-time GUI tuning enables discovery-driven implementation (pivot quickly)

**Strong Pattern: Implementation staying within scope estimates**
- Camera zoom: 60 lines vs 15-30 estimate (growth justified by debug UI value)
- Debug visuals: ~150 lines vs 80-120 estimate (healthy iteration included)
- Pose blending: 46 lines vs 40-60 estimate ✓ exact
- Walk transition: 20-40 estimate ✓ within range
- Tilt scaling: 10 lines vs 8-12 estimate ✓ exact
- **Learning:** Line count estimates increasingly accurate; patterns proven

#### Completion/Deferral Analysis

**Successful Completions:**

1. **Camera zoom deferred initially (Oct 9→Oct 10), completed second attempt**
   - Why deferred: Simple feature workflow validation needed
   - What enabled success: User involvement, bug discovery, architectural improvement
   - Key learning: Simple features can handle 2x scope growth if staying same session

2. **All other features completed first attempt**
   - Pose blending: Quaternion validation from Static Keyframe Preview paid dividends
   - Walk transition: Architectural audit (controller ownership) prevented migration issues
   - Tilt scaling: Pattern reuse (acceleration tilt system) eliminated unknowns
   - Debug visuals: Graybox-first (white spheres, gradients) prevented premature polish

**What enabled smooth completion:**
- Bottom-up dependency respect (all built on 90%+ certain foundations)
- Pattern reuse (spring-damper validated 3+ times, quaternion math proven)
- Real-time tuning (GUI sliders for rapid iteration)
- Graybox-first discipline (function before polish)
- User involvement during implementation (early feedback caught issues)

**Documented learnings (from completion notes):**

- **Camera zoom:** Immediate update requirement for state affecting rendering; spherical camera pivot geometry
- **Debug visuals:** Reusable primitives (velocity trail, plot functions) for future features
- **Pose blending:** Hemisphere correction (dot product) for quaternion interpolation
- **Walk transition:** Dual reference pattern (immutable target + smoothed state)
- **Tilt scaling:** Reference speed anchoring prevents misleading visuals

**No deferrals this period** - 100% completion rate vs 62.5% in Retrospective 1
- Improvement driven by: problem evidence enforcement, data structure validation, certainty calibration

### Refactors

#### Planning Phase

**Strong Pattern: Rule of three enforcement preventing premature abstraction**
- Yaw direction utilities: 4 instances identified (exceeds threshold) ✓
- Joint slider widget: 8 instances (267% over minimum) ✓
- Y-axis up vector: 14 instances (467% over minimum) ✓
- **Learning:** All refactors well-justified by repetition count

**Strong Pattern: Complexity estimates accurate**
- Yaw utilities: 2 points estimated, 2 points actual ✓
- Joint slider: 2 points estimated, 2 points actual ✓
- Y-axis constant: 2 points estimated, 2 points actual ✓
- **Learning:** Simple refactors (single file or clear call site mapping) consistently hit estimates

**Strong Pattern: Risk assessment matching outcomes**
- All rated "Low Risk" - all completed without issues ✓
- Justifications: isolated changes, debug-only code, proven transformations
- **Learning:** Risk criteria (certainty scores, system isolation, trivial revert) predictive

#### Execution Phase

**Strong Pattern: Linear approach appropriate for low-complexity refactors**
- All 3 used linear migration (Prepare → Migrate → Validate)
- No staged migrations needed (low call site counts, isolated systems)
- **Learning:** Linear works for: single file changes, <15 call sites, 2-point complexity

**Strong Pattern: Call site accuracy in planning**
- Yaw utilities: 4 identified, 4 migrated ✓
- Joint slider: 8 identified, 8 migrated ✓
- Y-axis constant: 12→14 (2 discovered during grep, added to plan) ✓
- **Learning:** Initial grep mostly accurate; dynamic plan updates when new sites found

**Strong Pattern: Hidden dependency discovery during validation**
- Joint slider refactor discovered pre-existing bug (override persistence)
  - Not caused by refactor; exposed during validation testing
  - Correctly documented in MAINTENANCE_BACKLOG instead of deferring refactor
- Y-axis constant found 2 additional literals during second pass
- **Learning:** Thorough validation catches unrelated issues; triage appropriately

**Exceptional Pattern: Refactors documenting coordinate system conventions**
- Yaw utilities: Encoded Y-up, Z-forward convention in function docs
- Y-axis constant: Explicitly named `math::UP` to document world orientation
- **Learning:** Refactors are opportunities to capture implicit domain knowledge

#### Completion/Deferral Analysis

**All refactors completed successfully:**

1. **Yaw direction utilities** - "Clarity over cleverness" - `math::yaw_to_forward()` self-documenting
2. **Joint slider widget** - 83 lines → 40 lines (48% reduction), adding new joints now 1 line
3. **Y-axis up vector constant** - 14 literals → 1 named constant, documents coordinate system

**Impact achieved:**
- Code clarity: All improved readability (named functions/constants vs raw math)
- Maintainability: Joint widget addition now trivial; coordinate system explicit
- Consistency: Single source of truth for repeated patterns
- Foundation building: Reusable utilities for future features

**Learnings captured:**
- Rule of three satisfaction correlates with valuable abstractions
- Debug-only refactors have low risk, high learning value
- Coordinate system conventions worth documenting in code

### Maintenance Fixes

#### Complexity Classification

**Path A (Trivial) - 3 fixes:**
- C-style void parameters: 1 point estimate ✓ signature change only
- printf logging: 1 point estimate ✓ remove diagnostic + include
- Unused parameter markers: 2 points estimate ✓ attribute replacements

**Path B (Standard) - 1 fix:**
- Joint override reset: 1-2 points estimate → 3-4 actual (quaternion bug + pipeline restructure)

**Learning:** Trivial classification accurate when scope limited to style/convention fixes; Standard fixes can uncover deeper issues

#### Scope & Discovery

**Critical Pattern: "Trivial" maintenance revealing architectural issues**
- Joint override reset investigation revealed:
  1. Primary issue: GUI state not resetting on transitions
  2. Hidden issue: Quaternion identity representation bug
  3. Architectural issue: Transform update scattering across pipeline
- Scope expanded from GUI reset (2 points) to full pipeline restructure (4 points)
- **Justification:** All discoveries related to root cause investigation
- **Learning:** Maintenance as investigation tool - don't stop at symptoms

**Strong Pattern: Scope discipline in trivial fixes**
- C-style void: Changed only parameter declarations ✓
- printf logging: Removed diagnostic + unused include ✓
- Unused parameters: Applied [[maybe_unused]] only ✓
- **Learning:** Trivial fixes stayed trivial; no "while we're here" scope creep

**Exceptional Pattern: Architectural improvements during debugging**
- Joint override fix centralized transform updates (3-step pipeline)
- Externalized secondary motion for clarity
- Documented quaternion identity representation
- **Verdict:** Improvements justified as diagnostic artifacts, not scope creep
- **Learning:** Distinguish investigation artifacts (valuable) from unrelated changes (defer)

#### Process Effectiveness

**Two-tier review working well:**
- Path A skipped review, went straight to finalization ✓ appropriate for style fixes
- Path B got code review, discovered architectural insights ✓ justified for complex fix
- **Learning:** Review path selection accurate based on complexity

**Learning capture quality:**
- All maintenance fixes documented learnings in backlog
- Joint override fix: Extensive process and technical learnings captured
- Pattern learnings: "No similar issues found" documented for each fix
- **Learning:** Even trivial fixes generate process insights worth capturing

**Batch opportunity identification:**
- C-style void, printf, [[maybe_unused]] - all main.cpp style fixes
- Completed as separate fixes, but could have been batched
- **Retrospective question:** Should similar file/category fixes be batched proactively?

### Cross-Cutting Observations

#### Feature/Refactor/Maintenance Interleaving

**Healthy interleaving pattern observed:**
- Oct 10: Feature (camera zoom) → Refactor (yaw utilities) → Feature (debug visuals)
- Oct 11: Refactor (joint slider) → Feature (pose blending) → Feature (walk transition) → Maintenance (joint override) → Feature (tilt scaling) → Refactor (Y-axis constant) → Maintenance batch (3 fixes)
- **Observation:** No conflicts; each work type complemented others
- **Learning:** Mix of features/refactors/maintenance prevents monotony, maintains code health

**Synergies observed:**
- Joint slider refactor discovered override reset bug → maintenance fix improved animation pipeline
- Debug visual feature created reusable primitives → unlocked future telemetry features
- Refactors documenting conventions (UP constant, yaw utilities) → clearer future feature code
- **Learning:** Maintenance reveals architectural improvements; refactors enable features

**Workflow friction points:**
- Zero major friction - all work types followed established workflows
- Minor: Commit message backtick parsing (PowerShell script issue)
- **Learning:** Process maturity high; small tooling fixes only remaining friction

#### Workflow Consistency

**Exceptional Pattern: Workflow adherence without deviation**
- Features: All followed SELECT_FEATURE → PLAN_IMPLEMENTATION → REVIEW → FINALIZE
- Refactors: All followed SELECT → PLAN → IMPLEMENT → REVIEW → FINALIZE
- Maintenance: All followed SELECT → IMPLEMENT → (REVIEW if Path B) → FINALIZE
- **Learning:** Workflow templates working well; no ambiguity in process

**Strong Pattern: Documentation quality improving**
- All features have completion dates, certainty calibration, reflection notes
- All refactors have execution summaries, validation results, finalization
- All maintenance fixes have scope assessments, learnings captured
- **Learning:** Retrospective 1 documentation improvements adopted consistently

**Emerging Pattern: Certainty calibration becoming standard practice**
- All features include predicted vs actual certainty analysis
- All include variance analysis and calibration adjustments
- Pattern recognition improving (exponential smoothing, quaternion slerp examples)
- **Learning:** Certainty tracking improving estimate accuracy over time

   - Zero premature abstractions
   - **Evidence:** All refactors improved clarity without over-engineering

8. **Pattern reuse over reinvention**

    - All work includes "What went well", "What caused friction", "What would you do differently"
    - Learnings captured for future reference
    - **Evidence:** Process improvements traceable to specific retrospective insights

### 🛑 Stop Doing

1. **Underestimating certainty for debug tool features**
   - Debug visuals: 60% predicted, completed smoothly (should have been 85-90%)
   - Walk transition: 60% predicted, completed smoothly (should have been 85-90%)
   - **Evidence:** Both built on stable infrastructure (95%+ certain systems) with clear integration
   - **Action:** Debug tools and parameter exposure deserve 80-90% certainty when extending proven systems

2. **Treating scope growth as universally negative**
   - Camera zoom 2x scope growth (30→90 min) created high-value architecture (unified Debug Panel)
   - All growth was debug tools (zero gameplay risk), same session completion
   - **Evidence:** "Scope creep" stigma prevented recognizing valuable organic evolution
   - **Action:** Distinguish harmful scope creep (feature bloat, multi-session coordination) from valuable evolution (debug tools, same-session discoveries)

3. **Batching unrelated maintenance fixes separately**
   - C-style void, printf, [[maybe_unused]] - all main.cpp style fixes completed separately
   - Could have been single "code standards cleanup" batch
   - **Evidence:** 3 separate commits for related file/category fixes
   - **Action:** Proactively batch similar maintenance items (same file, same category, same day)

### 🆕 Start Doing

1. **Certainty boost rule for debug tool features**
   - **Proposal:** Features extending stable infrastructure (90%+ certain) for debug/iteration tools get +20-30% certainty boost
   - **Rationale:** Pattern observed twice this retro (debug visuals, walk transition); both underestimated by ~40 points
   - **Implementation:** Add checklist to SELECT_FEATURE: "Is this a debug/iteration tool on proven infrastructure? Apply certainty boost"
   - **Success criteria:** No more 60% predictions for features that complete smoothly

2. **Dual-reference pattern documentation**
   - **Proposal:** Document the "immutable target + smoothed state" pattern for future reference
   - **Rationale:** Walk transition discovered this pattern (run_speed vs max_speed); prevents circular dependencies
   - **Implementation:** Add to AGENTS.md under "Reactive Systems" section with walk transition example
   - **Success criteria:** Future smoothed variables designed correctly first attempt

3. **Proactive maintenance batching**
   - **Proposal:** When 3+ maintenance items share same file/category, create batch item in backlog
   - **Rationale:** C-style void + printf + [[maybe_unused]] could have been single "main.cpp standards" batch
   - **Implementation:** Add to MAINTENANCE/SELECT_ITEM: "Scan for similar file/category items before starting; propose batch if 3+ found"
   - **Success criteria:** Fewer single-line-change commits; related fixes grouped logically

4. **Coordinate system convention documentation**
   - **Proposal:** Create CONVENTIONS.md documenting coordinate systems, axis conventions, rotation directions
   - **Rationale:** Yaw utilities and Y-axis constant refactors revealed implicit conventions worth making explicit
   - **Implementation:** Document Y-up, Z-forward, right-hand rule in foundation docs; reference from refactors
   - **Success criteria:** New contributors can find coordinate system rules without code archaeology

5. **Scope evolution acceptance criteria for simple features**
   - **Proposal:** Simple features can grow up to 2x scope estimate if: (1) same session, (2) debug tools only, (3) architectural improvements discovered
   - **Rationale:** Camera zoom validated this pattern; creates value without coordination overhead
   - **Implementation:** Add to FEATURE/WORKFLOW.md under "Simple Feature Criteria"
   - **Success criteria:** Valuable organic evolution not stigmatized as "scope creep"

6. **Pre-implementation mode comparison for multi-mode features**
   - **Proposal:** When adding feature to mode B that exists in mode A, explicitly compare implementation patterns
   - **Rationale:** Camera zoom one-frame delay (FOLLOW vs ORBIT update patterns)
   - **Implementation:** Add to PLAN_IMPLEMENTATION checklist: "Does this feature span multiple modes? Compare existing mode implementations"
   - **Success criteria:** Mode-specific bugs caught during planning, not testing
