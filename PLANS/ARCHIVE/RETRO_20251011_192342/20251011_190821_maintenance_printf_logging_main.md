# printf Logging in Production Code

**Severity:** Medium

**Current Issue:** `runtime().initialize()` logs the sokol MSAA sample count to stdout on every launch, leaving development diagnostics in the production entry point.

**Files Affected:** src/main.cpp

**Suggested Fix:** Remove the `printf` entirely or guard it behind a debug-only compile flag so release builds stay silent.

**Workflow Path:** Path A (Trivial)

**Estimated Complexity:** 1 point
