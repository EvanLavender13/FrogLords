# Extract Joint Slider Widget Pattern

**Current State:** 8 nearly-identical joint override sections with 3 sliders each (24 slider calls total) in `src/gui/character_panel.cpp` lines 157-239. Each uses same structure: TreeNode wrapper with three slider_float calls ranging from -180.0f to 180.0f for X/Y/Z Euler angles.

**Proposed Change:** Extract reusable helper function to eliminate repetition:

```cpp
namespace gui {
void draw_joint_angles_widget(const char* label, glm::vec3& angles,
                              const char* x_label, const char* y_label, const char* z_label) {
    if (ImGui::TreeNode(label)) {
        widget::slider_float(x_label, &angles.x, -180.0f, 180.0f);
        widget::slider_float(y_label, &angles.y, -180.0f, 180.0f);
        widget::slider_float(z_label, &angles.z, -180.0f, 180.0f);
        ImGui::TreePop();
    }
}
}
```

Replace 8 repetitions with clean call sites:
```cpp
draw_joint_angles_widget("Left Shoulder", state.left_shoulder_angles,
                         "X-axis (twist)", "Y-axis (fwd/back)", "Z-axis (up/down)");
```

**Affected Systems:** 
- Single file: `src/gui/character_panel.cpp`
- Debug GUI code (no gameplay impact)
- Animation state remains unchanged (only UI presentation layer)

**Rationale:**
- **Rule of Three Satisfied:** 8 repetitions far exceeds threshold (267% over minimum)
- **Clarity over Cleverness:** Self-documenting function name makes intent explicit
- **Simplicity:** Reduces 83 lines to ~40 lines (48% reduction)
- **Maintainability:** Adding new joints becomes single function call instead of 7-line block
- **Pattern Extraction:** "Abstract repeated patterns into systems" (AGENTS.md principle)
- **Error Prevention:** Eliminates copy-paste errors (range mismatches, missing TreePop, etc.)

**Impact:**
- Single file change (character_panel.cpp)
- Net reduction: ~43 lines of code
- Makes adding future joints trivial (1 line vs. 7 lines each)
- Zero behavioral change (pure refactoring)

**Estimated Complexity:** 2 points (Simple)
- Add helper function to `character_panel.cpp` anonymous namespace or gui namespace
- Replace 8 blocks with 8 function calls
- Visual verification through GUI interaction

**Risk Level:** Low
- Debug-only GUI code (no gameplay logic)
- Single file in isolated system
- Easy visual verification (all sliders must work identically)
- No dependencies on other systems
- Can be tested immediately by opening character panel and moving sliders

## Execution Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-11
**Approach Used:** Linear (single pass)

**Changes Made:**
1. Added `draw_joint_angles_widget()` helper function in anonymous namespace at top of file
2. Replaced all 8 joint angle blocks with single-line function calls
3. Preserved all comments documenting bone orientation conventions
4. Maintained all axis label customizations per joint

**Files Modified:**
- `src/gui/character_panel.cpp` - Added helper function, replaced 8 repetitive blocks (83 lines → 40 lines)

**Line Count Impact:**
- Before: 260 lines total, 83 lines for joint controls
- After: 217 lines total, 40 lines for joint controls
- Net reduction: 43 lines (16.5% smaller file)

**Build Verification:**
- ✅ Compiles without errors or warnings
- ✅ Application runs successfully
- ✅ GUI renders correctly

**Visual Verification:**
All 8 joint angle controls work identically:
- ✅ TreeNode collapsing/expanding
- ✅ Three sliders per joint (X/Y/Z)
- ✅ Range -180.0f to 180.0f maintained
- ✅ Custom axis labels preserved per joint
- ✅ All state bindings functional

**Issues Encountered:** None

**Deviations from Plan:** None - followed straightforward linear approach as planned

## Finalization

**Date:** 2025-10-11
**Status:** COMPLETED

**Final Validation Results:**
- ✅ Compiles without errors or warnings
- ✅ Application runs successfully
- ✅ All 8 joint angle TreeNodes render correctly
- ✅ All sliders functional with correct range (-180° to 180°)
- ✅ Custom axis labels preserved per joint type
- ✅ No regressions in character animation or debug GUI

**Issues Discovered During Testing:**
- **Joint Override Persistence Bug:** Discovered pre-existing issue where override angles persist across pose changes, causing confusing UX behavior. Documented in `MAINTENANCE_BACKLOG.md` under High priority.
  - Issue 1: Overrides on T-Pose appear to have no effect (actually working, but T-pose identity rotations make changes invisible)
  - Issue 2: Overrides set on walk poses remain applied when switching to other poses
  - Root cause: `character_panel_state` never resets override angles on pose change
  - Not caused by this refactor; pre-existing behavior exposed during validation

**Documentation Updates:** None required (helper function is file-local implementation detail)

**Backlog Updates:**
- Moved to Completed section in `REFACTOR_BACKLOG.md`
- Documented learnings and impact metrics
- Added new maintenance item for override persistence bug

**Next Steps:**
- Refactor complete and merged to codebase
- Joint override reset behavior tracked in MAINTENANCE_BACKLOG (High priority)
- Pattern established for future GUI widget extraction
