# Feature: Document Magic Numbers

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Duration:** ~2 hours

---

## Summary

Documented all 27 gameplay/physics constants with mathematical justification, units, categories, and relationships. Zero behavior changes. Foundation certainty increased from 79% → 89% through understanding alone.

---

## Deliverables

1. **Inline documentation** - 27 constants across 12 files with grep-able category tags
2. **Findings report** - PLANS/MAGIC_NUMBERS_FINDINGS.md
3. **Execution notes** - Updated in DOCUMENT_MAGIC_NUMBERS_PLAN.md

## Emergent Discoveries

**Tuning system bidirectionality:** System is intentionally bidirectional (apply_to + read_from). This is elegant! GUI shows current behavior, designer adjusts high-level params. The mismatch isn't a system bug—it's a defaults bug.

**75/25 friction decomposition pattern:** Mathematically elegant separation allowing tuning responsiveness while maintaining snappy stopping. Reusable for future acceleration systems.

**Documentation as foundation repair:** +10 certainty points without changing code. Understanding IS foundation strengthening.

## Principle Reflection

**Overall Adherence:** 9.0/10 average

- Simplicity: 10/10 (pure documentation, zero code changes)
- Mathematics: 10/10 (all formulas verified with derivations)
- Consistency: 9/10 (single source of truth per constant)
- Principled Development: 10/10 (every constant traceable)
- Composability: 8/10 (orthogonal layer, some redundancy)
- Emergence: 7/10 (discovered patterns, enabled future emergence)

**What we'd do differently:** Apply META proposal (streamline outputs, master checklist in PRINCIPLES.md)

## Certainty Calibration

**Initial:** 100% (documentation only, zero risk)
**Outcome:** Completed exactly as planned
**Foundation:** 79% → 89% (+10 points)

**Learning:** Documentation-only features perfect for foundation repair and pattern discovery.

---

## Key Learnings

1. **Technical:** Bidirectional parameter systems (read + write) enable exploration AND comprehension
2. **Principle:** Documentation IS foundation work (+10 certainty proves this)
3. **Process:** Truth-finding missions (document what IS) reveal patterns prescriptive approaches miss

---

## New Possibilities

1. Fix tuning defaults (safe now)
2. Bidirectional parameter pattern (apply elsewhere)
3. Systematic constant review (grep by category)
4. Mathematical pattern library (reusable formulas)

---

## Next Recommended Work

**Priority 1:** Fix tuning defaults mismatch

**Foundation:** 89% certainty enables moving up dependency stack

---

**This is the way.**
