# Decouple Character Tuning from Locomotion

**Severity/Priority:** Critical

**Current Issue:** The free function `sync_locomotion_targets` in `src/character/tuning.h` creates a tight coupling between the `controller` and `locomotion_system`. This violates the layered architecture by having a utility function reach into two separate components to synchronize them.

**Files Affected:**
- `src/character/tuning.h`
- `src/character/tuning.cpp`
- `src/character/controller.h`
- `src/character/controller.cpp`
- `src/app/game_world.h`
- `src/app/game_world.cpp`

**Proposed Fix:** The `controller` will take ownership of the `locomotion_system`. The synchronization logic will be moved into a private method within the `controller`, ensuring that the controller is solely responsible for managing its subsystems.

**Rationale:** This change improves encapsulation and clarifies ownership, reducing the risk of desynchronization and adhering to the project's layered architecture principles.

**Workflow Path:** Path B (Standard)

**Estimated Complexity:** 3 points

**Risk Level:** Low. The change is a straightforward refactoring that clarifies ownership and does not alter behavior.

**Augmentations:** architecture_boundary, signature_change

## PLAN

**Created:** 2025-10-15

**Branch:** `improve/character-tuning-dependency`

### Impact Analysis

**Affected Systems:**
- `controller`: Will own the `locomotion_system`.
- `game_world`: Will no longer own `locomotion_system` and will access it through the `controller`.
- `character_panel`: Will receive the `locomotion_system` from the `game_world` which gets it from the `controller`.

**Dependencies:**
- `game_world` depends on `controller`.
- `character_panel` depends on `game_world`.

**Risk Level:** Low

**Risk Factors:**
- The change touches several files, increasing the chance of a mistake.

**Mitigation:**
- The change will be done in small, verifiable stages.
- Each stage will be followed by a build to ensure no regressions are introduced.

### Proposed Changes

**Stage 1:** Move `locomotion_system` to `controller`
- Add `#include "character/locomotion.h"` to `src/character/controller.h`.
- Add `locomotion_system locomotion;` as a public member of the `controller` struct in `src/character/controller.h`.
- Remove `locomotion_system locomotion;` from `src/app/game_world.h`.
- Remove `#include "character/locomotion.h"` from `src/app/game_world.h`.
- Validation: Build will fail, this is expected.

**Stage 2:** Update `game_world` to access `locomotion` via `character`
- In `src/app/game_world.cpp`, replace all instances of `locomotion` with `character.locomotion`.
- This will affect `game_world::init()` and `game_world::update()`.
- Validation: Build will still fail, but the errors related to `locomotion` in `game_world` should be resolved.

**Stage 3:** Move `sync_locomotion_targets` logic to `controller`
- Add a new private method `void sync_locomotion_targets();` to the `controller` struct in `src/character/controller.h`.
- In `src/character/controller.cpp`, implement the `controller::sync_locomotion_targets` method by copying the logic from the free function in `src/character/tuning.cpp`. The implementation should use the `locomotion` member of the `controller`.
- In `src/character/controller.cpp`, inside `controller::update`, call `sync_locomotion_targets()` after the `max_speed` is updated.
- Validation: Build will still fail due to the old `sync_locomotion_targets` call.

**Stage 4:** Remove old `sync_locomotion_targets` function
- Remove the declaration of `sync_locomotion_targets` from `src/character/tuning.h`.
- Remove the definition of `sync_locomotion_targets` from `src/character/tuning.cpp`.
- Remove the call to `character::sync_locomotion_targets` from `src/app/game_world.cpp`.
- Validation: Clean build succeeds (no errors, no warnings).

## PLAN REVIEW

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Status:** APPROVED

### Summary

The plan to decouple the character tuning logic by moving the `locomotion_system` into the `controller` is well-structured and directly addresses a critical architectural violation. It improves encapsulation and clarifies system ownership, adhering to the project's layered architecture principles. The risk is low and the reward is high. The plan is approved for execution.

### Violations (Must Fix)

No violations found. The plan corrects an existing violation.

### Risks & Concerns

Plan appears well-aligned. The primary risk is a simple mistake during the multi-file refactoring, but the staged approach with build validation at each step effectively mitigates this.

### Deviations from Plan

The initial execution of the plan resulted in build errors. The plan was not thorough enough and missed some call sites that needed to be updated. The plan was mentally updated to include the necessary fixes, and the execution was re-attempted successfully.

### Learning Points

- A more thorough analysis of the codebase is needed during the planning phase to identify all call sites of a function or member that is being modified or removed.
- The iterative process of "plan -> execute -> build -> fix" is effective at catching such issues.
