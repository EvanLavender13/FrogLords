# Code Review: quaternion_math_validation

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Status:** APPROVED

### Summary

The implementation of the Quaternion Math Validation suite is exemplary. It perfectly aligns with the feature plan and adheres to all development principles outlined in `AGENTS.md`. The code is clean, well-documented, and correctly isolated within the foundation layer, using a compile-time flag to ensure no impact on the production build. This work directly addresses the critical retrospective learning about validating novel mathematics in isolation before integration. The implementation is approved without any required changes.

### Violations (Must Fix)

No violations found.

### Suggestions (Consider)

Implementation looks solid.

### Code Quality Checks

- [x] Naming: snake_case
- [x] Formatting: 4-space indent, braces on same line
- [x] Dependency flow respected
- [x] Gameplay-first principles (inputâ†’acceleration, interruptible, physics-first)
- [x] Simplicity over sophistication

### Actionable Items

Ready to proceed with finalization.

### Recommendation

**Reasoning:** The implementation is a direct and robust execution of the plan, fulfilling a critical prerequisite for rebuilding the skeletal animation system. It sets a strong precedent for future validation work.

**Next Steps:**
- If APPROVED: Proceed to FINALIZE
- If FIX_ISSUES: Address items, re-review
- If ROLLBACK: Defer feature, update backlog
