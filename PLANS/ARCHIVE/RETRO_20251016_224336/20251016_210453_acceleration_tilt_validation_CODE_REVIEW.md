# Code Review: Acceleration Tilt Math Validation

**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Status:** APPROVED

## Summary
The implementation is a textbook execution of the plan. It perfectly replicates the successful quaternion validation pattern, creating a comprehensive, isolated test suite for the acceleration tilt mathematics. The code is exceptionally clean, well-documented, and adheres strictly to all project conventions. The developer also proactively refactored the old quaternion validation file into the new `tests` directory, improving project structure.

## Violations (Must Fix)
- **None.** The code is in perfect alignment with all principles and standards.

## Quality Checks
- Naming: ✓ snake_case
- Formatting: ✓ 4-space indent, same-line braces
- Dependencies: ✓ Proper flow, clean separation in `foundation/tests`
- Gameplay: ✓ N/A (isolated math validation)
- Simplicity: ✓ Excellent. Logic is extracted and tested cleanly.

## Recommendation
**Next:** FINALIZE. The feature is complete and of high quality.
