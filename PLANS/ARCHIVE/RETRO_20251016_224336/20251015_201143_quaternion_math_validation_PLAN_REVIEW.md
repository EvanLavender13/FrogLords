# Principle Review: quaternion_math_validation

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Status:** APPROVED

### Summary

The plan for the Quaternion Math Validation suite is exceptionally well-aligned with the project's core development principles as defined in `AGENTS.md`. It directly addresses the critical lesson learned from the recent skeletal animation system failure by proposing to validate a novel data structure (quaternions) in complete isolation before integration. The implementation plan is thorough, low-risk, and perfectly scoped. This feature is a textbook example of the "validate in isolation" and "build from the bottom-up" directives. The plan is approved for immediate execution.

### Violations (Must Fix)

**NOTE:** Categorize for retrospectives (Premature Polish | Missing Prerequisites | Scope Creep | Reactive Control | System Duplication | Other)

No violations found.

### Risks & Concerns

Plans appear well-aligned. The only minor risk is the potential for bugs in the underlying GLM library, but discovering them through this validation suite would be a valuable outcome in itself.

### Actionable Items

Ready to proceed with implementation as outlined in `PLANS/ARCHIVE/20251015_201143_quaternion_math_validation_PLAN.md`.

### Recommendation

**Reasoning:** The plan is a direct and robust response to a major project retrospective. It is low-risk, high-value, and unblocks significant future work on the skeletal animation system. It perfectly embodies the project's development philosophy.

**Next Steps:**
- If APPROVED: Proceed to EXECUTE
- If REVISE: Address items, re-review
- If DEFER: Update DESIGN_BACKLOG with findings
