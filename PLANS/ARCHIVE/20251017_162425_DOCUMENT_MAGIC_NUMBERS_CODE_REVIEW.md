# Code Review: Document Magic Numbers

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Decision:** APPROVED

## Principle Validation
1. Radical Simplicity: PASS - Documentation-only; no new complexity introduced
2. Composable Functions: PASS - Comments clarify single-purpose constants and relationships
3. Mathematical Foundations: PASS - Derivations and units documented, formulas verified
4. Emergent Behavior: PASS - Enables exploration by exposing relationships; prescribes nothing
5. Consistency: PASS - Units, categories, and tags consistent across files
6. Principled Development: PASS - Every constant justified and traceable

## Mathematical Verification
**Formulas:** Validated
**Coordinates:** Consistent (Y-up, Z-forward) and explicitly documented
**Stability:** Verified where relevant (e.g., critical damping, exponential smoothing)
**Debug Vis:** Adequate (existing systems; not modified by this feature)

## Emergent Discoveries
- Tuning system duality (apply_to/read_from) enables round-trip design
- 75/25 friction decomposition pattern exposes elegant control tuning

## Prescribed Behaviors
- None introduced by this feature (documentation only)

## Simplification Opportunities
- Align tuning defaults vs controller defaults (single source of truth)
- Optionally document spring default rationale as “safe fallbacks” in one place

## Technical Quality
- Naming: ✓ snake_case throughout
- Architecture: ✓ No dependency changes
- Cleanliness: ✓ No dead code added; only comments
- Documentation: ✓ Decisions and derivations explained inline with grep-able tags

## Critical Issues
- None introduced. Note: existing mismatch between tuning defaults and controller defaults remains (tracked separately as Priority 1 follow-up).

## Recommendation
### If APPROVED:
The implementation upholds all principles. Proceed to FINALIZE.

## The Test
Can we say: "This code enables documentation-driven understanding through simple, grep-able rules, validated by mathematics, maintaining all six principles"?

Answer: YES - Pure documentation increases foundation certainty without adding complexity.
