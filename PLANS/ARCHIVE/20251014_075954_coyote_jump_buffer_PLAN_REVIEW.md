# Principle Review: Coyote Jump Buffer

**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Status:** APPROVED

### Summary

The implementation plan for the "Coyote Time + Jump Buffer" feature is exceptionally well-aligned with the project's development principles as outlined in `AGENTS.md`. The plan demonstrates a clear understanding of bottom-up development, graybox-first iteration, and maintaining the integrity of core mechanics. It builds upon a stable foundation (95% certain Character Controller) and correctly defers polish and non-essential scope. The proposed changes are simple, additive, and present a low risk. The recommendation is to approve the plan and proceed with implementation.

### Violations (Must Fix)

No violations found.

### Risks & Concerns

- **Tuning Dependency:** The success of this feature is highly dependent on "feel" and tuning the window durations. The plan correctly identifies this and includes debug UI for real-time tuning, which is the appropriate mitigation.

Plans appear well-aligned with project principles.

### Actionable Items

No actionable items required before implementation.

### Recommendation

**APPROVED**

**Reasoning:** The plan is a textbook example of the project's desired development process. It is low-risk, high-value, and respects all core principles.

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed to EXECUTE.
