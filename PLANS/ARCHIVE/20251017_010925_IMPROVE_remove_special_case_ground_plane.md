# Remove Special-Case Ground Plane

## The Violation
**Principle:** Consistency + Radical Simplicity
**Files:**
- `src/foundation/collision.cpp:35-65` - `resolve_ground_collision()` function
- `src/foundation/collision.cpp:118-120` - Special-case call in `resolve_collisions()`

**Current:**
- Hardcoded ground plane at `y=0` handled separately from box collision
- Special function `resolve_ground_collision()` with ordering dependency
- Only checks ground if not already grounded by box collision (lines 39-42)
- Creates inconsistency: ground behaves differently than other collision surfaces

**Problem:**
- **Consistency Violation:** Ground is special-cased, not treated like other collision geometry
- **Simplicity Violation:** Two collision systems (box collision + special ground plane)
- **Ordering Dependency:** Ground only checked if box collision didn't set `is_grounded`
- **Principle Violation:** Special cases prevent emergence and predictability

## The Solution
**Approach:** Delete (remove special-case function, add ground as AABB)

**Changes:**
1. Delete `resolve_ground_collision()` function entirely (30 lines removed)
2. Remove call to `resolve_ground_collision()` from `resolve_collisions()`
3. Add large ground AABB to `setup_test_level()` like any other collision object

**Result:**
- Single unified collision system (box collision only)
- Ground behaves exactly like any other surface
- No special cases, no ordering dependencies
- Simpler, more consistent, more predictable

## The Justification

**Why Now:**
- Foundation stable (93% certainty)
- Consistency principle violation
- Enables deletion (entire function removed)
- Simple change (3 points, well-understood)

**Dependencies:**
- Collision system must remain stable (currently at 93%)
- Level setup adds ground AABB
- No other systems depend on ground plane being special

**Risk:** Low-Medium
- Collision system is fundamental, but change is well-understood
- Ground plane becomes regular AABB (same collision math)
- Single unified collision path is simpler
- Possible edge case: What if character spawns below ground?

## The Measure

**Before:**
- Lines: 30 (resolve_ground_collision function)
- Special cases: 1 (ground plane)
- Collision systems: 2 (boxes + ground)
- Ordering dependency: YES

**After:**
- Lines: 0 (function deleted) + ~8 (ground AABB in level setup)
- Special cases: 0 (ground is just another AABB)
- Collision systems: 1 (boxes only)
- Ordering dependency: NO

**Net:**
- Lines removed: 30
- Lines added: ~8
- Net deletion: -22 lines ✓
- Complexity reduction: Unified collision system ✓

**Test:**
1. Build succeeds
2. Character lands on ground (now an AABB at y=0)
3. Character lands on other platforms (unchanged)
4. No behavioral differences (ground acts like any surface)

Complexity: 3 points (simple)
Certainty: 90% (well-understood change, slight risk of edge cases)

## PLAN

## The Violation
**Principle:** Consistency + Radical Simplicity
**Measurement:**
- 2 collision systems (box + special ground)
- 30 lines of special-case code
- Ordering dependency in collision resolution

**Target:**
- 1 collision system (boxes only)
- 0 lines of special-case code
- No ordering dependencies

## The Strategy
**Approach:** Delete (remove special-case function)
**Risk:** Low-Medium
**Validation:** Visual (character lands on ground) + behavioral (no regressions)

## The Stages

### Stage 1: Add Ground AABB to Level
**Add:** Large ground AABB at y=0 in `setup_test_level()`
**File:** `src/app/game_world.cpp`
**Change:**
```cpp
// Add after grid floor visual (line 63):
// Ground collision plane (large AABB at y=0)
aabb ground_plane;
ground_plane.center = glm::vec3(0.0f, -0.1f, 0.0f);  // Centered below origin
ground_plane.half_extents = glm::vec3(100.0f, 0.1f, 100.0f);  // Large, thin box
world.scn.add_collision_box(ground_plane);
world.world_geometry.boxes.push_back(ground_plane);
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] Ground AABB appears in debug visualization
- [ ] Character lands on ground (both systems active, redundant)
- [ ] No regressions

**Rationale:** Add replacement before removing special case (safe rollback)

---

### Stage 2: Remove Special-Case Ground Function
**Remove:** `resolve_ground_collision()` function and call
**Files:**
- `src/foundation/collision.cpp:35-65` - Delete function
- `src/foundation/collision.cpp:118-120` - Remove call

**Changes:**
```cpp
// In resolve_collisions(), remove lines 118-120:
// Ground plane (fallback if no box collision)
resolve_ground_collision(collision_sphere, position, velocity, is_grounded, ground_normal,
                         ground_height);
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] Character still lands on ground (via AABB)
- [ ] Character still lands on platforms
- [ ] No behavioral differences
- [ ] Grounded state still set correctly

**Rationale:** Delete special case, rely on unified box collision

---

### Stage 3: Verify and Measure
**Measure simplification:**
- Count lines removed
- Verify single collision system
- Confirm no ordering dependencies
- Test edge cases (spawn height, falling, jumping)

**Verify:**
- [ ] All collision surfaces behave identically
- [ ] No special cases remain
- [ ] Consistency principle restored
- [ ] System simpler and more predictable

---

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Principle violation resolved (Consistency restored)
- [ ] Code is simpler (30 lines deleted, 8 added = -22 net)
- [ ] No functionality lost (ground still works)
- [ ] No new complexity added (single collision system)
- [ ] No ordering dependencies

## Edge Cases to Test
1. Character spawns at y=0 (on ground)
2. Character spawns above ground (falls to ground)
3. Character jumps and lands on ground
4. Character jumps and lands on platform
5. Character falls off platform edge to ground

## Rollback Strategy
If Stage 2 fails:
1. Git revert to restore `resolve_ground_collision()`
2. Keep ground AABB (redundant but harmless)
3. Investigate why unified collision failed

Complexity: 3 points
Confidence: 90%

## FINALIZATION

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Path:** B (Standard - 3 points)
**Duration:** ~5 minutes

### Simplification Summary
- Lines removed: 37 (collision.cpp)
- Lines added: 6 (game_world.cpp)
- Net deletion: **31 lines** (exceeded estimate of 22!)
- Special cases eliminated: 1 (ground plane)
- Collision systems unified: 2 → 1
- Ordering dependencies removed: 1
- Principle restored: Consistency + Radical Simplicity

### Files Modified
- `src/foundation/collision.cpp:35-65` - Deleted `resolve_ground_collision()` function
- `src/foundation/collision.cpp:118-120` - Removed special-case call
- `src/app/game_world.cpp:65-70` - Added ground AABB

### Pattern Identified
**Name:** Special-Case Fallback with Ordering Dependency

**Recognition Signs:**
- Functions with "fallback" or "if not already" logic
- Hardcoded special constants (like y=0)
- Ordering dependencies ("only check if X")
- Multiple systems doing similar physics
- Comments containing "special case"

**Resolution:**
- Treat all instances of a concept uniformly
- Delete special function
- Add instance to unified system (ground as AABB)
- Remove ordering dependencies

**Where Else:** None found in current codebase (pattern eliminated)

### Learnings

**What Worked:**
- Staged approach (add first, delete second) de-risked change
- Gemini caught the consistency violation during review
- Deletion achieved better results than estimated
- Unified system simpler and more predictable

**What Was Hard:**
- Nothing - straightforward deletion
- Initial fear of "what if ground is needed?" unfounded

**What to Remember:**
- Special cases are almost always deletable
- Unified systems beat multiple systems every time
- Ordering dependencies signal accidental complexity
- Trust deletion - fear of removing code usually wrong
- "If it works, don't touch it" is anti-simplification thinking

### New Violations Found
None discovered during this improvement.

### Estimation Calibration
**Estimated:** 3 points (simple)
**Actual:** 3 points (simple)
**Variance:** Accurate ✓
**Line reduction:** Exceeded estimate by 40% (-31 vs -22)

Deletion-focused improvements tend to exceed estimates on simplification.

### Impact on Foundation
**Before:** 93% certainty
**After:** 94% certainty
- Consistency principle restored
- No special cases in collision system
- Unified approach simpler to reason about
- No regressions

### Questions of Closure

1. **Is the codebase measurably simpler?** YES (-31 lines, -1 special case, -1 system)
2. **Is the principle truly restored?** YES (Consistency fully restored)
3. **Did we learn the pattern?** YES (Special-case fallback with ordering dependency)
4. **Would we make this change again?** YES (exactly as executed)
5. **What violations did we discover?** 0 (codebase clean)

**The codebase is simpler. The principles are stronger. The pattern is named. The ground is no longer special.**
