# Principle Review: secondary_motion

### 1. Summary
The iteration and implementation plans for the **secondary_motion** feature are in excellent alignment with the principles outlined in `AGENTS.md`. The plans demonstrate a strong commitment to proceduralism, iterative development, and building upon a stable foundation. The feature is correctly scoped as a minimal, reactive animation layer with clear success metrics and a tight feedback loop for tuning. No violations or significant risks were identified.

### 2. Violations & Contradictions
None. The plans are fully compliant with the established development principles.

### 3. Misalignments & Risks
None. The plans are well-aligned with the project's philosophy. The identified risks in the iteration plan (tuning difficulty, visual artifacts) are appropriate for the feature's scope and have clear, low-cost mitigation strategies. The implementation plan correctly translates the iteration plan's design into concrete, actionable steps.

### 4. Actionable Items
- [x] Proceed with implementation as planned.
- [x] No revisions to the plans are necessary.
