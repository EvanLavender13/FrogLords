# Code Review: Primary Skeletal Animation

### 1. Summary

The implementation successfully delivers distance-phased pose switching synchronized to surveyor-wheel locomotion. All code follows naming conventions, dependency flow, and gameplay-first principles. The feature is approved without required changes. Minor suggestions for future iterations are noted below.

### 2. Violations & Required Changes

None.

### 3. Misalignments & Suggestions

- **Misalignment:** Divide-by-zero safeguard violates "simplicity over sophistication"
  - **File:** [src/character/animation.cpp:102](src/character/animation.cpp#L102)
  - **Principle:** "Simplicity over sophistication" (AGENTS.md)
  - **Details:** `float safe_cycle_length = glm::max(cycle_length, 0.01f);` prevents divide-by-zero, but `cycle_length` is constrained to `[0.5f, 3.0f]` by GUI slider (character_panel.cpp:76), making the safeguard unreachable.
  - **Suggestion:** Remove safeguard and rely on UI constraints, or document defensive programming rationale if future refactoring may decouple UI/logic.

- **Misalignment:** NOLINT comment without explanation
  - **File:** [src/character/animation.cpp:108](src/character/animation.cpp#L108)
  - **Principle:** "Clarity over cleverness" (AGENTS.md)
  - **Details:** `// NOLINT(bugprone-branch-clone)` suppresses a warning for intentional branch duplication (two NEUTRAL pose selections at `phase < 0.5f` and `phase >= 0.75f`), but lacks contextual explanation.
  - **Suggestion:** Add brief comment explaining why branches are intentionally identical (e.g., `// Two NEUTRAL ranges (0.25-0.5, 0.75-1.0) frame steps symmetrically`).

- **Misalignment:** Walk speed lock uses hard velocity cap instead of acceleration adjustment
  - **File:** [src/character/controller.cpp:92-99](src/character/controller.cpp#L92)
  - **Principle:** "Input maps to acceleration" (AGENTS.md Procedural Animation)
  - **Details:** Shift-key walk speed lock (`is_walking`) clamps `velocity` directly, overriding momentum. While acceptable for debug/tuning, production implementation would adjust `max_speed` target or scale acceleration to preserve physics-first feel.
  - **Suggestion:** Document as tuning feature (already noted in implementation plan) or refactor to acceleration-based approach if feature graduates to production.
