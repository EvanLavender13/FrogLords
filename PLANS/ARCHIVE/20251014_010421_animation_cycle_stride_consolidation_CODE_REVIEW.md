# Code Review: Animation Cycle Stride Consolidation

**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Status:** APPROVED

### Summary

The implementation is a textbook example of iterative development and emergent design. The initial plan was solid, but testing revealed a flaw (phase instability). The implemented solution—passing the pre-calculated phase directly from locomotion to animation—is more robust and elegant than the original plan. It simplifies the animation system's responsibility and creates a clearer data flow. The code is clean, adheres to all principles, and fully accomplishes the feature's goal.

### Violations (Must Fix)

- No violations found.

### Suggestions (Consider)

- Implementation looks solid.

### Code Quality Checks

- [x] Naming: snake_case
- [x] Formatting: 4-space indent, braces on same line
- [x] Dependency flow respected
- [x] Gameplay-first principles (input→acceleration, interruptible, physics-first)
- [x] Simplicity over sophistication

### Actionable Items

- Ready to proceed with finalization.

### Recommendation

**Reasoning:** The implementation is excellent. It not only meets the requirements but improves upon the initial design based on discoveries made during implementation.

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed to FINALIZE.
