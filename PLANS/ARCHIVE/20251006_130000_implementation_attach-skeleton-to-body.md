# Implementation #### 3. Quality Gates

- [x] Build passes (`CMake: Build (Debug)`).
- [x] Lint/format clean (run clang-format/clang-tidy tasks).
- [x] Smoke run compiles and launches (`Run (Debug)`), and the skeleton should now move with the character. Attach Skeleton to Character Body

### Graybox Implementation Checklist

#### 1. Core Logic

- [x] **File:** `src/app/game_world.cpp`
    - [x] In `game_world::update()`, after the `character.update()` call, add logic to attach the skeleton to the character.
    - [x] Get the character's world transform matrix, which already includes position, orientation, and reactive offsets (tilt/spring). This is the same transform used by the debug body box.
    - [x] The line to add is: `t_pose_skeleton.joints[0].local_transform = character.get_world_transform();`
    - [x] This single line replaces the previous logic, ensuring the skeleton perfectly mirrors the debug body's position, rotation, and reactive animations.

#### 2. Refinement

- [x] **File:** `src/character/controller.h`
    - [x] Ensure the `get_world_transform()` method is public so it can be accessed from `game_world.cpp`.

#### 2. Quality Gates

- [ ] Build passes (`CMake: Build (Debug)`).
- [ ] Lint/format clean (run clang-format/clang-tidy tasks).
- [ ] Smoke run compiles and launches (`Run (Debug)`), and the skeleton should now move with the character.
