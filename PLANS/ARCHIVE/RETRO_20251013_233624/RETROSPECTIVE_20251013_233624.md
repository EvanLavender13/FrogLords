## Pattern Analysis

### Feature Iterations

**Planning Phase:**
Both features (air locomotion weights, run gait blending) followed the enhanced planning workflow with pre-implementation principle reviews. Air locomotion required 6 clarification questions before planning, which successfully prevented scope creepâ€”decisions like deferring coyote time and using T_POSE instead of new content kept the implementation minimal. Run gait blending built on 100% certain foundations (skeletal system, locomotion) and 95% certain dependencies, which accurately reflected in the smooth execution.

**Implementation Phase:**
Both features completed on first attempt with no deferrals or major rework. Air locomotion completed in ~2-3.5 hours against estimate, run gait blending in ~3 points of work. Dual-reference spring-damper pattern has now been used successfully 4 times (landing spring, acceleration tilt, contact weight, walk_factor smoothing), proving this is a validated reusable pattern. Implementation plans with foundation architecture reviews (system ownership, dependency verification) proved valuableâ€”both features correctly identified integration points and update order before coding.

**Completion/Deferral:**
100% completion rate. Air locomotion achieved all success criteria: zero visual pops, phase continuity, unchanged input responsiveness. One polish gap discovered (secondary motion joint limits) but correctly deferred to backlog rather than expanding scope. Run gait blending required one tuning iteration (exponential smoothing on walk_factor) which was anticipated in the plan and handled smoothly via debug UI.

### Improvements

**Planning Phase:**
8 improvements completed, split 6 Trivial Path (1-2 points) and 2 Standard Path (3-8 points). Complexity estimates were accurate: all Trivial completions took <15 minutes, both Standard paths took 1-2 hours as estimated. One improvement (extract walk/run blend calculation) was correctly rejected during plan reviewâ€”the "duplication" didn't actually exist, demonstrating effective plan validation catching false premises before implementation work.

Stability gate enforcement worked well: both Standard path improvements (character controller architectural fix, joint transform extraction) occurred after features stabilized. No refactor conflicts with active feature work observed. The architectural violation fixes (debug_draw â†’ app dependency, controller â†’ rendering dependency) were both tagged Critical and addressed promptly, preventing technical debt accumulation.

**Execution Phase:**
Staged execution approach proved effective for Standard path improvements. The character controller refactor used 5 stages (introduce collision_world, move logic, refactor controller, update debug draw, verify architecture), with each stage independently buildable. One hiccup: Stage 1 missed game_world.cpp signature update in the explicit changes list, but the plan review caught it and added to checklist before execution.

Pattern extraction followed the rule-of-three discipline well: joint transform extraction verified 3+ identical lambda occurrences before abstracting. Buffer pruning helper extracted from 2 identical blocks (acceptable for trivial scope). Walk/run blend calculation was investigated and correctly rejectedâ€”no third occurrence exists, avoiding premature abstraction.

**Scope & Discovery:**
Scope discipline was excellent across all 8 improvements. No scope creep observedâ€”each improvement stayed focused on its original problem statement. Two architectural violations discovered and fixed in sequence (debug_draw â†’ app, controller â†’ rendering), demonstrating how addressing one violation can surface related issues. The velocity_trail_state extraction to rendering layer was particularly cleanâ€”single struct move with no hidden dependencies.

Trivial path improvements completed faster than estimated (debug_draw dependency ~10min vs 15-20min estimate, constant consolidation ~5min accurate). This suggests the trivial path workflow overhead is well-tuned.

**Process Effectiveness:**
Plan reviews caught one false premise (walk/run blend duplication), preventing wasted implementation effort. Two-tier review (plan review â†’ code review) working well for Standard path improvementsâ€”plan review catches architectural issues, code review verifies implementation correctness.

Learning capture quality is strong. All improvements documented "what worked well" and "what was harder than expected" sections. Insights like "include management when extracting glm type functions" and "staged approach effective for complex refactors" provide concrete guidance for future work.

Batch opportunities: stdio include cleanup was investigated but correctly not batched (GUI still legitimately uses snprintf). This demonstrates good judgmentâ€”avoiding premature abstraction until shared formatting helper exists.

**Completion/Deferral:**
100% completion rate (7 completed + 1 rejected as unnecessary = 8/8 resolved). No deferrals due to unexpected complexity. Time estimates accurate: Trivial path averaged 1-2 points, Standard path averaged 5-8 points, actual execution matched estimates within Â±20%.

### Cross-Cutting Observations

**Feature/Improvement Interleaving:**
Clean separation observed. Features progressed sequentially (air locomotion â†’ run gait blending) without parallel improvement work causing conflicts. After run gait blending completed, a burst of 8 improvements executed in ~4 hours. This pattern (feature sprint â†’ improvement batch) appears intentional and effectiveâ€”improvements cluster after features stabilize rather than interleaving mid-feature.

**Workflow Friction Points:**
Parameter cleanup occasionally missed in initial plans (air locomotion's unused is_grounded parameter, controller refactor's game_world.cpp signature). Mitigation: explicitly include parameter removal in planning checklists when removing conditional gates or changing signatures.

**Process Synergies:**
Pre-implementation clarifications (air locomotion's 6 questions) + principle reviews + foundation architecture audits = very low deferral rate. The upfront investment in planning is paying off with smooth execution and no mid-implementation surprises.

Debug UI integration prioritized in both features enabled rapid tuning iteration. Contact weight frequency slider and blend mode isolation both proved valuable for visual validation, confirming the "design for iteration velocity" principle.

**Improvements as Investigation Tool:**
The stdio include cleanup discovered that GUI overlay helpers require snprintf, suggesting a future shared formatting helper might enable broader cleanup. The controller refactor surfaced that debug_draw also depended on collision data, leading to debug_draw signature update. Improvements are successfully identifying architectural concerns while fixing targeted issues.

## Findings

### âœ… Keep Doing

**Pre-Implementation Clarification Phase (Features):**
Air locomotion's 6 upfront questions (phase advancement semantics, weight relationships, visual targets, coyote time scope) resolved all ambiguity before planning, leading to zero mid-implementation surprises. This pattern prevented scope creep and locked minimal scope early.

**Dual-Reference Spring-Damper Pattern:**
Fourth successful use (landing spring, acceleration tilt, contact weight, walk_factor smoothing). Pattern is proven for smoothed state management without circular dependencies. Continue applying for similar use cases.

**Staged Execution for Standard Path Improvements:**
Character controller refactor's 5-stage breakdown (each independently buildable, <30min per stage) caught include dependency issues early. Stage-by-stage validation with incremental builds is fast and low-risk.

**Rule-of-Three Discipline for Pattern Extraction:**
Joint transform extraction correctly verified 3+ identical lambdas before abstracting. Walk/run blend investigation correctly rejected premature abstraction when third occurrence didn't exist. Continue enforcing "wait for third use" rule.

**Architectural Violation Prompt Fixes:**
Both Critical violations (debug_draw â†’ app, controller â†’ rendering) addressed within same work session, preventing debt accumulation. Continue tagging architectural issues Critical and addressing promptly.

**Debug UI Integration in Features:**
Contact weight frequency slider and blend mode isolation enabled rapid tuning. Visual feedback loops stay tight (seconds-minutes). Continue exposing tuning parameters and debug modes in initial feature implementations.

### ðŸ›‘ Stop Doing

**Omitting Parameter Cleanup from Initial Plans:**
Air locomotion missed unused is_grounded parameter in initial plan. Controller refactor missed game_world.cpp signature update in explicit changes list. While plan reviews caught both, this creates extra review burden.

**Assuming Duplication Without Verification:**
Walk/run blend extraction assumed duplication without code inspection, leading to rejected plan. This wasted planning effort on a non-existent problem.

### ðŸ†• Start Doing

**Include Parameter Removal in Planning Checklists:**
When removing conditional gates or changing function signatures, explicitly list parameter cleanup and call site updates as planning steps. This prevents code review suggestions and reduces review burden.

**Document Expected Polish Gaps Upfront:**
Air locomotion discovered secondary motion joint limits during validation but didn't predict this in planning. Add "known polish gaps" section to feature descriptions to tag expected rough edges as "defer" rather than "discover during validation."

**Verify Code Structure Before Planning Extractions:**
For improvement items that claim duplication, verify the actual code structure during analysis phase before creating plan. This prevents false premise plans like the walk/run blend extraction attempt.

**Track Pattern Reuse Count for Abstraction Triggers:**
Dual-reference spring-damper is at 4 uses. At 5-6 uses, consider centralizing pattern in foundation utilities to reduce per-use boilerplate. Start tracking pattern reuse counts in improvement opportunities.

## Proposed Workflow Changes

- [ ] **[DOC] TASKS/FEATURE/PLAN.md:** Add "Known Polish Gaps" section after "Success Criteria" to document expected rough edges that should be deferred rather than expanded into scope mid-validation.

- [ ] **[DOC] TASKS/FEATURE/PLAN.md:** Add explicit checkpoint in "Graybox Implementation Checklist" for parameter cleanup: "Review function signatures for unused parameters introduced by conditional removals or logic changes."

- [ ] **[DOC] TASKS/IMPROVE/PLAN.md:** Add verification step to analysis phase for pattern extractions: "For duplication claims, cite specific line numbers and verify code structure shows genuine duplication (not reuse of existing abstractions)."

- [ ] **[EXPERIMENT] Pattern Reuse Tracker:** For the next 3-5 iterations, track when proven patterns (dual-reference springs, surveyor-wheel phase, slerp blending) are reused. If any pattern hits 5+ uses, evaluate if centralization in foundation layer reduces boilerplate. Success criteria: decision made on centralization by 5th use.
