# Consolidate Tuning Constants

**Severity/Priority:** Medium

**Current Issue:** `FRICTION_RATIO = 0.75f` is duplicated in two functions in `src/character/tuning.cpp`.

**Files Affected:**
- `src/character/tuning.cpp`

**Proposed Fix:** Move the `FRICTION_RATIO` constant to a file-level anonymous namespace to be shared by both functions.

**Rationale:** This change improves code quality by removing duplication and creating a single source of truth for this tuning constant, following the principle of "Clarity over cleverness; simplicity over sophistication" from AGENTS.md.

**Workflow Path:** Path A (Trivial)

**Estimated Complexity:** 1 point

**Risk Level:** Low - This is a simple, localized change with no behavior modification.

**Tags:** #cleanup #constants
