# Code Review: Running Gait Keyframes

**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Status:** APPROVED

### Summary

Implementation approved. Code extends proven quaternion keyframe architecture cleanly with 4 walk poses (renamed + 1 new for symmetry) and 4 new run poses. All naming conventions followed (snake_case), formatting consistent (4-space indent, braces on same line), dependency flow respected (foundation → character → rendering → app). Gameplay-first principles maintained: manual pose selection preserves input→acceleration mapping, animation remains non-authoritative. Run poses show clear visual distinction (~1.5× arm swing and leg extension vs walk). All automatic animation references updated correctly. No violations detected.

### Violations (Must Fix)

**If none:** No violations found.

### Suggestions for Improvement

- **Pose Creation Consistency:** `create_walk_reach_right_pose()` constructs a temporary `walk_reach_left` keyframe but only uses the hip/knee values. Arms are independently defined. This is functionally correct but slightly inconsistent with the comment "mirror of WALK_REACH_LEFT (swap left/right joints)".
  - **File:** src/character/keyframe.cpp:122-138
  - **Impact:** Minor—code works correctly. For absolute clarity, could either (a) fully mirror by swapping all fields from walk_reach_left, or (b) update comment to reflect partial reuse. Not a blocker.

- **Run Pose Mirroring:** Run poses (RUN_REACH_RIGHT, RUN_PASS_LEFT) also manually construct all values rather than swapping from their counterparts. Consistent with walk implementation pattern.
  - **File:** src/character/keyframe.cpp:156-206
  - **Impact:** Negligible—explicit values make tuning easier and avoid mirror bugs. Current approach is defensible.

**If none:** Implementation looks solid.

### Code Quality Checks

- [x] Naming: snake_case (pose_type enum values, function names, variables all correct)
- [x] Formatting: 4-space indent, braces on same line, consistent spacing
- [x] Dependency flow respected (character layer only, no upward dependencies)
- [x] Gameplay-first principles: manual selection non-authoritative, animation follows physics
- [x] Simplicity over sophistication: straightforward enum extension, reuses proven patterns

### Additional Observations

**Strengths:**
- **Clear Documentation:** Pose creation functions include inline comments explaining intent ("exaggerated forward stride", "right leg crossing center")
- **Consistent Structure:** All 8 run/walk pose functions follow identical pattern (readability)
- **Exhaustive Coverage:** All switch statements updated (get_keyframe_data, apply_pose_with_overrides, animation.cpp pose selection, character_panel.cpp display names)
- **Tuning Ready:** Run poses seed with ~1.5× magnitudes as planned, ready for manual refinement via joint override UI

**Architecture Alignment:**
- Enum order matches UI dropdown order (prevents index misalignment bugs)
- T-pose reset pattern preserved (root transform saved/restored correctly)
- Automatic animation's 4-segment walk cycle unchanged (still uses 4 walk poses, ignores run poses per plan)

### Recommendation

**Status:** APPROVED

**Reasoning:** Implementation delivers exactly what the plan specified. All checklist items completed correctly. Code quality meets project standards. No gameplay-first violations. Run poses are graybox-ready for manual testing and tuning via existing joint override UI. Foundation for future speed-based gait switching is solid.

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed to FINALIZE_FEATURE workflow
- Future iteration: speed-based gait switching (walk/run blend triggered by velocity thresholds)
