## Pattern Analysis

### Feature Iterations

**Planning Phase:**
- Plans consistently approved on first review; scope small and graybox-friendly (e.g., axis gizmo toggle, four run keyframes, trail freeze gate).
- Minor clarity gaps surfaced early and were easy to fix: explicit cycle order for gait UI list; naming consistency checks.
- Strong architecture audits up front (ownership, call order, layering) prevented rework.

**Implementation Phase:**
- Steps were tight and verifiable (checklists, build + smoke runs). All predicted files matched actual changes.
- Debug tooling followed the reactive-layer rule: interpret state, don’t modify it.
- Self-verification loops were fast via Character Panel and debug draws; no latent issues reached review.

**Completion/Deferral:**
- All three iterations completed smoothly with zero deferrals.
- Learnings captured around certainty calibration and picking the simplest gate (position-delta vs velocity-threshold).

### Refactors

**Planning Phase:**
- Rule-of-three honored or explicitly justified (angle wrap: 3 sites; spherical calc: 3 sites; joint indices: data integrity exception with 2 sites).
- Systems met stability gates (≥70%) before extraction; low complexity (1–2 points) estimates were accurate.

**Execution Phase:**
- Linear migrations were sufficient; all call sites identified and updated as planned.
- No hidden dependencies discovered; compiler feedback caught any potential misses by design.

**Completion/Deferral:**
- All refactors completed. Clear impact: duplication removed, math utilities centralized, skeleton constants unified.
- Abstraction quality met expectations; intent became self-documenting at call sites.

### Maintenance Fixes

**Complexity Classification:**
- Classifications matched reality: trivial/path A for cosmetic consistency (PI constant, comment cleanup); standard/path B when legacy logic removal touched behavior surfaces.

**Scope & Discovery:**
- Fixes stayed focused; a few items (magic numbers, unused variables) reinforced opportunities to tighten const-correctness and naming consistency in future passes.

**Process Effectiveness:**
- Two-tier review worked: trivial items skipped heavy review; standard items received quick verification.

### Cross-Cutting Observations
- Strong reuse of established patterns: Character Panel toggles; wireframe debug + ImGui overlay; surveyor-wheel gait phasing; quaternion keyframes.
- Small graybox scopes minimized risk and sped iteration.
- Minor encoding artifacts appeared in several archived docs; content unaffected but suggests a future cleanup task.

## Findings

### Keep Doing
- Reuse proven debug visualization patterns (wireframe primitives + ImGui overlay) with simple panel toggles.
- Keep graybox scopes minimal and interruptible; verify with fast, self-serve UI loops.
- Enforce stability gates and rule-of-three (or clearly justify exceptions for canonical data).
- Consolidate shared math/indices into single sources of truth (foundation utils; `skeleton.h`).

### Stop Doing
- Relying on velocity-threshold gates for debug visuals when position-delta is simpler and more robust (freeze trail case).
- Omitting explicit UI ordering details when order matters (gait cycle list order).
- Duplicating canonical data (joint indices across multiple files) and sprinkling magic numbers (PI, easing constants).

### Start Doing
- Add a “simplest gate mechanism” check in feature planning for reactive visuals (compare position/angle deltas vs thresholds/heuristics).
- Include an explicit “UI ordering” checklist item whenever lists reflect semantic cycles (e.g., gait sequences).
- Add lightweight complexity estimates (points) to feature plans for calibration consistency (already used for refactors).
- Track small encoding/format anomalies as a maintenance batch item (archived docs normalization).

## Proposed Workflow Changes

### Task Updates
- [ ] FEATURE planning template: add “Gate Mechanism Review” (choose geometric deltas over thresholds when possible).
- [ ] FEATURE planning template: add “UI Ordering Verified” for cycle-based lists (e.g., gait phases).
- [ ] FEATURE planning template: include a “Complexity (points)” field like refactors.
- [ ] REFACTOR plan checklist: add a “Naming consistency across math utilities” tick (e.g., `_radians`/`_degrees` suffix symmetry).

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] `TASKS/WORKFLOW.md`: note the “Gate Mechanism Review” and “UI Ordering Verified” as common checkpoints in Feature workflow.
- [ ] `PLANS/DESIGN_BACKLOG.md`: encourage including a rough complexity estimate and intended validation loop for candidates.
- [ ] `PLANS/REFACTOR_BACKLOG.md`: clarify justified exceptions to rule-of-three for canonical data consolidation.

### Process Experiments
- [ ] Experiment: Apply the “simplest gate mechanism” check to the next 2–3 reactive debug features; track if planning/rework time decreases.
