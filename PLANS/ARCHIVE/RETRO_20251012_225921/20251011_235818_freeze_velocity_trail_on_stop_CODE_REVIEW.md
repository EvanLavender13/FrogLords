# Code Review: Freeze Velocity Trail on Stop

**Date:** 2025-10-11
**Status:** APPROVED

### Summary

Trajectory sampling now waits for actual movement before appending points and the new panel toggle keeps the trail fully within the debug layer, so the feature behaves exactly as scoped with no regressions observed.

### Violations (Must Fix)

No violations found.

### Suggestions for Improvement

Implementation looks solid.

### Code Quality Checks

- [x] Naming: snake_case
- [x] Formatting: 4-space indent, braces on same line
- [x] Dependency flow respected
- [x] Gameplay-first principles (inputâ†’acceleration, interruptible, physics-first)
- [x] Simplicity over sophistication

### Recommendation

**Reasoning:** Changes match the plan, respect layering principles, and keep the reactive visualization clean without touching core motion systems.
