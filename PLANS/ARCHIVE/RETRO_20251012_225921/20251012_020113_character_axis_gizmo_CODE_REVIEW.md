# Code Review: Character Axis Gizmo

**Date:** 2025-10-12
**Status:** APPROVED

### Summary

Implementation is approved. The character axis gizmo feature is complete, well-structured, and fully adheres to FrogLords development principles. The code cleanly extends existing debug draw patterns, maintains consistency with established conventions, and delivers the specified functionality with appropriate scope. No violations or blocking issues found.

### Violations (Must Fix)

No violations found.

### Suggestions for Improvement

- **Label font scaling consistency:** The 1.4x font size multiplier is hardcoded in `draw_axis_gizmo` but could be extracted as a named constant if other debug labels adopt the same scaling.
  - **File:** `src/rendering/debug_draw.cpp:359`
  - **Impact:** Minor readability improvement; not blocking.

### Code Quality Checks

- [x] Naming: snake_case
- [x] Formatting: 4-space indent, braces on same line
- [x] Dependency flow respected
- [x] Gameplay-first principles (inputâ†’acceleration, interruptible, physics-first)
- [x] Simplicity over sophistication

### Detailed Analysis

**Code Standards Compliance:**
- Naming conventions: Consistent snake_case throughout (`draw_axis_gizmo`, `axis_visual`, `safe_normalize`, `show_axis_gizmo`)
- File organization: Correct placement in `src/rendering/debug_draw.{h,cpp}`, `src/gui/character_panel.{h,cpp}`, `src/app/runtime.cpp`
- Formatting: Clean 4-space indentation, same-line braces, consistent operator spacing
- Documentation: Appropriate inline comments for non-obvious logic (safe normalization, label projection)

**Gameplay-First Principles:**
- Pure debug visualization; zero gameplay impact
- No control stealing or latency introduction
- Interruptible via simple boolean toggle
- Correctly respects "do no harm" rule

**Simplicity & Clarity:**
- Reuses existing patterns (`generate_arrow`, ImGui foreground label projection from `draw_skeleton`)
- Clean separation of concerns: draw logic in `debug_draw.cpp`, UI state in `character_panel.h`, render hook in `runtime.cpp`
- Simple toggle mechanism with no unnecessary complexity
- Safe normalization with explicit fallback handling prevents degenerate cases

**Systemic Design:**
- Follows established debug draw patterns (`draw_context`, wireframe rendering)
- Reuses `generate_arrow` primitive rather than custom geometry
- Label projection matches existing skeleton label approach
- Minimal new code (~90 lines total across all files)

**Dependency Flow:**
- No improper dependencies introduced
- Debug draw remains at rendering layer
- GUI panel correctly manages state
- Runtime orchestrates render calls appropriately

**Implementation Specifics:**
- Correctly extracts root transform basis vectors from `skel.joints[0].model_transform`
- Uses full root orientation (not yaw-only) as specified
- RGB color mapping correct: X=red, Y=green, Z=blue (with slight adjustment to Z for better visibility: `IM_COL32(0, 128, 255, 255)`)
- Label placement beyond arrow tips with appropriate offset (`axis_length + HEAD_SIZE * 0.25f`)
- Proper viewport clipping and depth testing for labels
- Default axis length 0.6m and head size 0.08m are reasonable for character scale
- Empty skeleton guard prevents edge case crashes

**Integration Quality:**
- Checkbox placed logically in Character Panel under "Skeleton" section
- Default state OFF as specified
- Render call correctly conditioned on `panel_state.show_axis_gizmo`
- Proper call ordering: skeleton drawn first, then gizmo (visual hierarchy)

### Recommendation

**Status:** APPROVED

**Reasoning:** Implementation is complete, principled, and production-ready. The feature cleanly extends existing debug visualization infrastructure with zero gameplay risk. Code quality is high, adhering to all FrogLords conventions. Scope is appropriately minimal for a v1 debug tool. The single minor suggestion (font size constant extraction) is a nice-to-have, not a requirement.

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed to FINALIZE_FEATURE
- Consider font size constant extraction in future debug draw refactoring (optional)
