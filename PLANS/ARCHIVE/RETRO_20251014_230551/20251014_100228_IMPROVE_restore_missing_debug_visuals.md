# Restore Missing Debug Visualizations

**Severity/Priority:** Medium

**Current Issue:** A regression occurred during a recent architectural refactoring (`IMPROVE_reverse_dependency_in_rendering_layer`) where several debug visualizations disappeared. This includes the locomotion wheel, physics spring, character body, foot positions, and speed circle.

**Files Affected:**
- `src/rendering/wireframe.h`
- `src/rendering/wireframe.cpp`
- `src/app/debug_generation.cpp`
- `src/rendering/debug_draw.cpp`
- `CMakeLists.txt`

**Proposed Fix:** Move the procedural mesh generation functions (e.g., `generate_box`, `generate_spring`) from the `rendering` layer to a new file in the `foundation` layer. This will make them accessible to the `app` layer, allowing the debug generation logic to be fully implemented and restoring the missing visuals.

**Rationale:** This fixes a critical regression in debug-ability and completes the original architectural goal. Placing geometry utilities in the `foundation` layer is the correct architectural pattern, as it allows any higher layer to use them without creating dependency violations.

**Workflow Path:** Path B (Standard)

**Estimated Complexity:** 5 points

**Risk Level:** Low. This is a clean, architectural refactoring with a clear goal and minimal risk of side effects.

## PLAN (Revised)

**Created:** 2025-10-14
**Revised:** 2025-10-14

**Branch:** `improve/restore_missing_debug_visuals`

### Impact Analysis

**Affected Systems:**
- `foundation`: Will gain a new set of files for procedural mesh generation.
- `rendering`: The `wireframe` and `debug_draw` systems will be updated to use the new `foundation` utilities.
- `app`: The `debug_generation` system will be updated to call the new `foundation` utilities to restore visuals.

**Dependencies:**
- This change correctly places geometry generation in the `foundation` layer, making it a dependency for `app` and `rendering`, which aligns with the project architecture.

**Risk Level:** Low

**Risk Factors:**
- The main risk is improper modification of `CMakeLists.txt` or include paths, which will be caught immediately by the compiler.

**Mitigation:**
- The work is broken into two small, verifiable stages. Each stage will result in a successful build.

### Proposed Changes

**Stage 1: Move Generators and `wireframe_mesh` to Foundation**
- **Action:** Create `src/foundation/procedural_mesh.h` and `.cpp`. Move the `edge`, `wireframe_mesh`, and all related config/generator functions from `src/rendering/wireframe.h` and `.cpp` to these new foundation files.
- **Details:**
    1. Create the new foundation files.
    2. Move the `edge` struct, all config structs (`sphere_config`, `box_dimensions`, etc.), and the `wireframe_mesh` struct from `rendering/wireframe.h` to `foundation/procedural_mesh.h`.
    3. Move the declarations of all `generate_*` functions to `foundation/procedural_mesh.h`.
    4. Move the definitions of all `generate_*` functions from `rendering/wireframe.cpp` to `foundation/procedural_mesh.cpp`.
    5. Update `CMakeLists.txt` to include the new `foundation/procedural_mesh.cpp`.
    6. Update all files that previously included `rendering/wireframe.h` (like `rendering/debug_draw.cpp`, `app/runtime.cpp`) to include `foundation/procedural_mesh.h` instead.
- **Validation:** The project compiles successfully with no change in behavior. Existing visuals remain unchanged.

**Stage 2: Restore Missing Visuals**
- **Action:** Modify `src/app/debug_generation.cpp` to generate the missing primitives.
- **Details:**
    1. In `debug_generation.cpp`, add a helper function that can take a `wireframe_mesh` and convert its geometry into `debug_line` primitives to be added to the `debug_primitive_list`.
    2. Add back the generation logic for the missing visuals (spring, wheel, body, feet, speed circle). This will involve calling the `generate_*` functions from the foundation layer and using the new helper to convert the results into `debug_line` primitives.
- **Validation:** The project compiles and all previously missing debug visuals are restored.

### Validation Checklist

**Build & Compile**
- [ ] Clean build succeeds (no errors, no warnings).
- [ ] All affected files compile.

**Correctness**
- [ ] All debug visualizations, including the previously missing ones, are rendered correctly.
- [ ] No regressions in existing visuals or application behavior.

**Architecture**
- [ ] `foundation` layer now correctly contains the procedural geometry code.
- [ ] `rendering` and `app` layers correctly depend on `foundation` for this functionality.

**Code Quality**
- [ ] `clang-format` and `clang-tidy` pass.

### Rollback Strategy

**Abort Conditions:**
- If a build fails after a stage and the fix is not immediately apparent.
- If the refactoring introduces unexpected complexity or side effects.

**Rollback Steps:**
1. Run `git reset --hard HEAD` to discard all changes.
2. Return to the main branch.
3. Re-evaluate the plan.

## PLAN REVIEW

**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Status:** REVISE

### Summary

Plan addresses a known regression (deferred visuals from previous architectural refactor) and correctly identifies foundation layer as proper home for procedural mesh generators. However, Stage 1 introduces premature abstraction (`mesh_geometry` struct) that violates "wait for third use" principle. Recommend simplifying: skip Stage 1 abstraction, move `generate_*` functions to foundation as-is (returning `wireframe_mesh`), and restore visuals directly in `debug_generation.cpp` without new primitive type.

### Violations (Must Fix)

- **Premature Abstraction:** Stage 1 creates `mesh_geometry` struct with only 2 uses (wireframe_mesh, debug_mesh)
  - **Principle:** "Wait for third use" (rule of three) from AGENTS.md
  - **Fix:** Skip Stage 1 entirely. Move `generate_*` functions to foundation layer without creating new abstraction. Functions can return `wireframe_mesh` from foundation—there's no architectural violation in foundation defining a mesh structure that rendering uses.

- **Severity Mislabeling:** Marked "Critical" but this is a known, documented deferral
  - **Principle:** Accurate prioritization for planning
  - **Fix:** Reclassify as "Medium" priority—improves debug-ability but doesn't block development

### Risks & Concerns

- **Complexity Without Benefit:** Adding `mesh_geometry` abstraction plus `debug_mesh` primitive type adds ~50-80 lines of boilerplate for marginal purity
  - **Mitigation:** Simplified approach: `generate_*` functions return `wireframe_mesh` directly. `debug_generation.cpp` calls `generate_spring()`, converts result to primitives (lines/spheres), adds to existing primitive lists. No new abstractions needed.

- **Missing Visual Restoration:** Current `debug_primitive_list` has lines/spheres/boxes but plan adds `debug_mesh`. Simpler to decompose procedural meshes into existing primitives.
  - **Mitigation:** Convert `wireframe_mesh` edges to `debug_line` primitives in generation step. Avoids new primitive type, reuses existing rendering path.

### Risk Assessment

**Risk Level:** Medium  
**Reward Level:** Medium  
**Decision:** Proceed with Caution (after revisions)

**Rationale:**
- Files: 5-6 (Medium-High)
- Systems: 3 (foundation, rendering, app) = Medium
- Certainty: Foundation 90-100% = Low
- Behavioral: Restores visuals = Medium
- **Net:** Medium risk, Medium reward = Proceed (but simplify first)

### Stage Quality

**Stage Breakdown:** Needs Simplification

Current plan has 3 stages but can be reduced to 2:

**Recommended Simplified Stages:**

1. **Move Generators to Foundation** (~20 min)
   - Create `src/foundation/procedural_mesh.h` and `.cpp`
   - Move all `generate_*` declarations and definitions (keeping `wireframe_mesh` return type)
   - Move config structs (sphere_config, box_dimensions, etc.) to foundation header
   - Update CMakeLists.txt
   - Update includes in `debug_draw.cpp` and `runtime.cpp`
   - Validation: Build passes, existing visuals unchanged

2. **Restore Missing Visuals** (~30 min)
   - In `debug_generation.cpp`, add helper to convert `wireframe_mesh` to `debug_line` primitives
   - Add generation functions for missing visuals (springs, wheels, body, feet) calling foundation's `generate_*`
   - Convert results to existing primitives (lines for edges, spheres for key points)
   - Validation: All visuals restored, build passes

**Validation Checklist:** ✓ (adequate with simplified approach)

### Actionable Items

- [ ] Remove Stage 1 (mesh_geometry abstraction)
- [ ] Update Stage 2 (now Stage 1): Move generators to foundation without introducing `mesh_geometry`
- [ ] Update Stage 3 (now Stage 2): Restore visuals using existing `debug_line`/`debug_sphere` primitives, not new `debug_mesh`
- [ ] Reclassify severity from "Critical" to "Medium"

### Recommendation

**Reasoning:** Core goal (restore visuals, improve architecture) is sound but execution adds unnecessary abstraction. The "rule of three" principle prevents premature extraction. Foundation layer can contain `wireframe_mesh` definition without architectural violation—it's a pure data structure. Simplified approach achieves same goal with less code, less risk, and better adherence to "simplicity over sophistication" principle.

**Next Steps:**
- Revise plan to remove premature abstraction
- Simplify to 2 stages as outlined above
- Re-review after revision (or proceed if revision accepted)

## EXECUTION (Standard Path)

**Started:** 2025-10-14
**Completed:** 2025-10-14
**Total Duration:** ~30 minutes

### Stage-by-Stage Summary

**Stage 1: Move Generators and `wireframe_mesh` to Foundation**
- Completed: 2025-10-14
- Issues: Build failed initially due to missing namespace qualifications and not updating `CMakeLists.txt`. The issues were resolved by correcting includes and build file entries across all affected files.

**Stage 2: Restore Missing Visuals**
- Completed: 2025-10-14
- Issues: 
    - A bug was discovered after the initial implementation where the locomotion wheel was incorrectly transformed. This was corrected by replicating the original, correct logic of generating the wheel's vertices manually in world space.
    - A second bug was found where all line-based primitives were being drawn with the same color due to improper batching in the renderer. This was fixed by implementing a color-sorting and batching system in `debug_draw.cpp`.
    - A third bug was found where the character body primitive was not tilting with acceleration. This was fixed by using the character's full world transform matrix when generating the body mesh.

### Full Validation Results

**Build & Compile**
- [x] Clean build succeeds (no errors, no warnings)
- [x] All affected files compile

**Correctness**
- [x] All debug visualizations, including the previously missing ones, are rendered correctly.
- [x] No regressions in existing visuals or application behavior.

**Architecture**
- [x] `foundation` layer now correctly contains the procedural geometry code.
- [x] `rendering` and `app` layers correctly depend on `foundation` for this functionality.

**Code Quality**
- [x] `clang-format` and `clang-tidy` pass.

### Deviations from Plan

- No deviations from the *revised* plan.

### Learning Points

- Moving files between architectural layers requires careful and systematic updating of all include paths and namespace qualifications. A compiler-guided approach (fixing errors as they appear) is effective.
- The "simplicity over sophistication" principle, as highlighted in the plan review, led to a much cleaner and lower-risk implementation.

## CODE REVIEW

**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Status:** APPROVED

### Summary

Implementation successfully restores all missing debug visualizations (springs, locomotion wheel, character body, speed ring, foot positions) while correctly moving procedural mesh generation to foundation layer. Architectural refactoring is clean with proper namespace usage (`foundation::`). Color batching fix eliminates previous line rendering bug. All execution notes confirm successful validation. Code quality is high with appropriate helper functions (`mesh_to_debug_lines`) and logical structure. Minor formatting inconsistency in wheel generation but acceptable.

### Violations (Must Fix)

No violations found.

### Concerns (Consider)

- **Formatting Inconsistency:** `generate_locomotion_wheel_primitives` has inconsistent vertical spacing (blank lines between statements)
  - **File:** `src/app/debug_generation.cpp:106-176`
  - **Impact:** Low - minor style issue, doesn't affect functionality
  - **Action:** Optional cleanup - can be addressed with clang-format or left as-is

- **Stub Files Retained:** `wireframe.h` and `wireframe.cpp` are now minimal stubs forwarding to foundation
  - **File:** `src/rendering/wireframe.h`, `src/rendering/wireframe.cpp`
  - **Impact:** Low - backward compatibility during refactor, can be removed in future cleanup
  - **Action:** Document as technical debt if planning future removal, or keep indefinitely as compatibility layer

### Code Quality Checks

- ✅ Naming: snake_case throughout (mesh_to_debug_lines, generate_locomotion_wheel_primitives)
- ✅ Formatting: 4-space indent, braces on same line (minor spacing inconsistency noted)
- ✅ Dependency flow: Foundation → Character → App → Rendering (correct)
- ✅ No scope creep: Changes limited to restoring visuals as planned
- ✅ Comments accurate: Good explanatory comments (e.g., "full world transform", "color batching")
- ✅ No side effects: Pure additive changes, existing functionality preserved

**Batch Opportunities Noted:**
- None.

### Learnings

**What Worked Well:**
- The revised 2-stage plan was much cleaner and avoided premature abstraction.
- Iteratively fixing the build errors after the major file move was an effective strategy.
- The bug-fix cycle (report -> analyze -> fix -> verify) worked smoothly.

**What Was Harder Than Expected:**
- The initial refactoring had several subtle downstream effects (transformation bug, color batching bug) that were not caught until visual testing. This emphasizes the need for thorough visual validation after any rendering-related change.

**Insights for Future Work:**
- When refactoring, be wary of over-simplifying logic that handles complex transformations. The original implementation is often complex for a good reason.
- Generic rendering helpers (like the original line renderer) can be a source of subtle bugs when state (like color) is implicitly shared.

**Time Estimate Accuracy:**
- Estimated: 5 points
- Actual: ~5 points. The core task was straightforward. The subsequent bug fixes added time but were part of the overall execution process.
- Variance: Accurate
