# Code Review: Coyote Time + Jump Buffer

**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Status:** APPROVED

### Summary

The implementation is a clean, direct, and robust execution of the feature plan. It successfully introduces coyote time and a jump buffer, enhancing jump reliability without violating core gameplay principles. The code adheres to all project standards for naming, formatting, and architecture. The changes are localized to the character controller and its debug UI, matching the plan's scope precisely. The implementation is approved and ready for finalization.

### Violations (Must Fix)

No violations found.

### Suggestions (Consider)

Implementation looks solid.

### Code Quality Checks

- [x] Naming: snake_case
- [x] Formatting: 4-space indent, braces on same line
- [x] Dependency flow respected
- [x] Gameplay-first principles (inputâ†’acceleration, interruptible, physics-first)
- [x] Simplicity over sophistication

### Actionable Items

Ready to proceed with finalization.

### Recommendation

**Reasoning:** The implementation is a textbook example of a well-planned and executed feature. It correctly uses timers to create forgiving input windows, directly addressing the "dropped input" feel without altering the core physics. The logic for executing jumps and preventing exploits (like double jumps) is sound. The addition of debug sliders and readouts in the GUI is exactly what's needed for fine-tuning.

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed to FINALIZE
