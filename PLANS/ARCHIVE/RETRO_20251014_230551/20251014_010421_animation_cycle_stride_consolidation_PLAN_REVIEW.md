# Principle Review: Animation Cycle Stride Consolidation

**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Status:** APPROVED

### Summary

The plan to consolidate animation cycle length with locomotion stride is strongly aligned with core development principles. It simplifies the architecture by creating a single source of truth for stride length, directly following the "surveyor wheel" design pattern. The implementation is minimal, builds upon a stable foundation, and was identified through iterative playtesting. This is a textbook example of a high-quality, principle-aligned feature.

### Violations (Must Fix)

**NOTE:** Categorize for retrospectives (Premature Polish | Missing Prerequisites | Scope Creep | Reactive Control | System Duplication | Other)

- No violations found. This plan resolves an existing implicit violation where the animation and locomotion systems had duplicated, conflicting concepts of stride length.

### Risks & Concerns

- **Tuning Required:** As noted in the plan, the new, more realistic cadence may require retuning the base `walk_stride` and `run_stride` values to achieve the desired feel. This is a low-risk, expected part of the iteration process, not a flaw in the plan.
  - **Mitigation:** Use the existing debug UI to tune stride lengths during playtesting.

### Actionable Items

- No actionable items beyond the implementation plan itself.

### Recommendation

**Reasoning:** The plan is a clear win for system elegance and architectural consistency. It has a minimal, well-defined scope and builds on a stable foundation.

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed to EXECUTE.
