# Plan Review: Document Magic Numbers

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Decision:** REVISE

## Principle Validation
1. Radical Simplicity: PASS - Single-purpose, doc-only, irreducible minimal plan.
2. Composable Functions: PASS - Orthogonal layer; composes with all systems; one responsibility.
3. Mathematical Foundations: PASS - Stages 2–3 require units, formulas, and verification.
4. Emergent Behavior: PASS - Documents truth, avoids prescribing outcomes; enables discovery.
5. Consistency: PASS - Units and relationships create predictability and trust.
6. Principled Development: PASS - Bottom-up, reversible stages; traceable decisions.

## Critical Issues
- Scope inconsistency: Includes rendering/UI constants (e.g., background color) despite “skip rendering/debug layout constants.” Remove from scope.
- Stage validation visibility: Review standard requires “Can it be seen?”/debug visualization. For doc-only, explicitly define per-stage visibility artifacts (tables/reports) to satisfy this.

## Simplification Required
- Remove non-gameplay/rendering constants from scope (e.g., background color). Optionally defer camera sensitivity if not gameplay-physics critical.
- Consolidate outputs into one canonical markdown table (Stage 2) and one findings report (Stage 5) to minimize artifacts.

## Mathematical Validation
- For CALCULATED values, include equation and numeric substitution (e.g., jump_velocity ↔ jump_height via v = √(2gh)).
- For COEFFICIENTS, document dimensionless meaning and linkage to unitful quantities (e.g., friction × |g|) with dimensional analysis checks.
- For DERIVED constants, cite formulas (e.g., c_critical = 2√(k·m)) and assumptions (mass, reference frame).

## Emergence Assessment
- Enables discovery of relationships, redundancies, and simplifications; avoids prescribing specific values; increases foundation certainty.

## Risk Analysis
**Mathematical:** Misclassification/units errors. Mitigation: peer review of Stage 2 table; spot-check derivations.
**Integration:** None (doc-only). Mitigation: N/A.
**Principle:** Drift into prescriptive refactor. Mitigation: findings-only; no code changes this feature.

## Recommendation

### If APPROVED:
Proceed with 5 stages, with explicit visibility artifacts and strict gameplay/physics scope.

### If REVISE:
- Remove rendering/debug constants from scope; clarify final scope list in plan.
- Add explicit “visibility artifacts” per stage:
  - Stage 1: Survey checklist (file→constant index)
  - Stage 2: Units/categories table (canonical)
  - Stage 3: Derivations/justifications sheet with sources
  - Stage 4: Grep-able tags in comments ([DERIVED|PHYSICAL|TUNED|CALCULATED|COEFFICIENT])
  - Stage 5: Findings report (prioritized)
- Add acceptance checks: sample audit (N≥10) for units and derivation trace.

### If REJECT:
N/A — scope is valid after minor revisions.

## The Test
Can we say: "This documentation system will make every constant explainable through mathematical validation, enabling emergent understanding while maintaining all six principles"?

Answer: NO — pending removal of rendering constants and explicit per-stage visibility artifacts; otherwise YES.
