# Plan Review: Debug Visualization System

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Decision:** APPROVED

## Principle Validation
1. Radical Simplicity: PASS - Minimal immediate-mode primitives; toggleable; no gameplay coupling. Demand: start with axes/line only; defer arrowhead complexity if needed.
2. Composable Functions: PASS - Orthogonal primitives (line, axes, arrow, sphere) compose cleanly; lifecycle isolated.
3. Mathematical Foundations: PASS - Assertions, startup checks, invariant validation specified; epsilon use defined.
4. Emergent Behavior: PASS - Visualizes truth; prescribes nothing; enables discovery across systems.
5. Consistency: PASS - One-way dependency (physics→visual); predictable toggle; no state accumulation.
6. Principled Development: PASS - Bottom-up staged plan; each stage has purpose, validation, and reversibility.

## Critical Issues
- Verify and reuse existing src/rendering/debug_draw.* API to avoid duplication (Stage 0 gate).
- Keep release builds free of overhead; confirm compilation flags and guard macros.

## Simplification Required
- Reuse existing assert/log utilities if present; only add debug_assert.h if truly missing.
- Implement arrow without head initially (shaft-only) to reduce complexity; add head later if needed.
- Limit sphere segments to minimal (e.g., 12–16) and make constant configurable.

## Mathematical Validation
- Startup checks: basis orthonormality, RH rule (X×Y=Z), rotation preserves frame.
- Per-primitive: normalized vectors, finite inputs, positive lengths/radii, distance/length postconditions.
- Visual: RGB axes alignment, velocity arrow magnitude scaling, collision sphere radius/center match.

## Emergence Assessment
- Enables: coordinate audits, motion/force inspection, collision verification, drift detection.
- Prescribed: none; strictly read-only visualization; immediate-mode rendering only.

## Risk Analysis
**Mathematical:** Precision/epsilon misuse → Use glm::epsilonEqual with shared eps; assert normalization.
**Integration:** API conflict with existing debug_draw → Do Stage 0 inventory; adapt naming to fit.
**Principle:** Complexity creep (extra features like text overlays) → Defer/omit; keep primitives only.

## Recommendation

### If APPROVED:
Proceed with 8 stages (0–7), validating all six principles at each. Gate Stage 1+ on Stage 0 findings; prefer reuse over new code.

### If REVISE:
Only if Stage 0 reveals overlapping APIs or missing line rendering; update API surface accordingly and resubmit deltas.

### If REJECT:
N/A

## The Test
Can we say: "This system will visualize state through mathematically validated primitives, enabling emergent debugging behaviors while maintaining all six principles"?

Answer: YES - Plan is minimal, math-first, reversible, composable, and enables emergence without prescribing outcomes.
