# Extract Joint Transform Application

**Severity/Priority:** Medium

**Current Issue:** Repeated lambda functions `apply_joint` and `apply_blended_joint` in `src/character/keyframe.cpp` and `src/character/animation.cpp` for applying joint transforms.

**Files Affected:**
- `src/character/keyframe.cpp`
- `src/character/animation.cpp`
- `src/character/skeleton.h`
- `src/character/skeleton.cpp`

**Proposed Fix:** Add a new function `set_joint_rotation(skeleton&, int, const glm::quat&)` in `skeleton.h` and `skeleton.cpp` to encapsulate the logic of applying a joint rotation.

**Rationale:** This change will reduce code duplication and improve maintainability by centralizing the joint rotation logic. This follows the "Clarity over cleverness; simplicity over sophistication" principle from AGENTS.md.

**Workflow Path:** Path B (Standard)

**Estimated Complexity:** 3 points

**Risk Level:** Low - This is a simple refactoring that is well-contained.

**Tags:** #pattern-extraction #skeleton

## PLAN

**Created:** 2025-10-14

**Branch:** `improve/extract_joint_transform_application`

### Impact Analysis

**Affected Systems:**
- `character/skeleton` (skeleton.h, skeleton.cpp)
- `character/keyframe` (keyframe.cpp)
- `character/animation` (animation.cpp)

**Dependencies:**
- `keyframe.cpp` and `animation.cpp` both depend on `skeleton.h`
- No reverse dependencies introduced (adding utility function to skeleton)

**Risk Level:** Low

**Risk Factors:**
- Pattern verified to occur 3+ times (lines 238-244, 319-323 in keyframe.cpp; 197-203 in animation.cpp)
- Simple utility function that preserves existing behavior
- Well-contained within character layer

**Mitigation:**
- Each stage independently verifiable with build
- No changes to public API of animation or keyframe systems
- Function signature matches all three usage patterns

### Proposed Changes

**Stage 1: Add `set_joint_rotation()` to skeleton**
- Add function declaration to `skeleton.h` after `update_global_transforms()`
- Implement function in `skeleton.cpp`
- Signature: `void set_joint_rotation(skeleton& skel, int joint_idx, const glm::quat& rotation)`
- Logic: Extract T-pose position from joint, build transform = translate * mat4_cast(rotation)
- Validation: Clean build succeeds, no warnings

**Stage 2: Refactor `apply_pose()` in keyframe.cpp**
- Replace lambda `apply_joint` (lines 238-244) with calls to `set_joint_rotation()`
- Keep all 8 `apply_joint()` calls, just change the function being called
- Validation: Build succeeds, visual check that T-pose and walk poses render correctly

**Stage 3: Refactor `apply_pose_with_overrides()` in keyframe.cpp**
- Replace lambda `apply_joint` (lines 319-323) with calls to `set_joint_rotation()`
- Keep all 8 function calls unchanged, only the lambda definition is removed
- Validation: Build succeeds, tuning UI still functions with pose overrides

**Stage 4: Refactor `update_skeletal_animation()` in animation.cpp**
- Replace lambda `apply_blended_joint` (lines 197-203) with calls to `set_joint_rotation()`
- Keep all 8 function calls, change function name in calls from `apply_blended_joint` to `set_joint_rotation`
- Validation: Build succeeds, walk/run animation blending works, no visual regressions

### Validation Checklist

#### Build & Compile
- [ ] Clean build succeeds (no errors, no warnings)
- [ ] All affected files compile

#### Correctness
- [ ] T-pose renders correctly (stage 2)
- [ ] Walk keyframe poses render correctly (stage 2)
- [ ] Tuning UI pose overrides work (stage 3)
- [ ] Walk/run blending animates smoothly (stage 4)
- [ ] No visual regressions in character animation

#### Architecture
- [ ] Dependency flow correct (Foundation → Character → Rendering → App)
- [ ] No reverse dependencies introduced
- [ ] Function added to appropriate layer (skeleton utilities)
- [ ] Follows naming conventions (snake_case)

#### Code Quality
- [ ] All 3 lambda duplications removed
- [ ] ~20-30 LOC reduction achieved
- [ ] Function signature matches all use cases
- [ ] No duplicated logic remains
- [ ] clang-format applied
- [ ] clang-tidy passes

### Rollback Strategy

**Abort Conditions:**
- If any stage fails to build
- If visual regression in character animation detected
- If performance degrades measurably

**Rollback Steps:**
1. Use `git restore src/character/skeleton.h src/character/skeleton.cpp src/character/keyframe.cpp src/character/animation.cpp` to discard changes
2. Return to `main` branch with `git checkout main`
3. Document findings in `IMPROVE_BACKLOG.md` with deferral reason

### Deviations from Plan

None. All stages executed as planned.

### Learning Points

- Include management: When adding function to header that uses glm types, must include appropriate glm headers in the header file, not just the implementation
- Pattern extraction worked smoothly: All 3 usage sites had identical logic, making extraction straightforward
- Incremental builds validated each stage quickly (1-2 files recompiled per stage)
- Keeping utility lambdas (`compose_rotation`, `blend_channel`) was correct—they encapsulate call-site-specific logic, not reusable utilities

## FINALIZATION

**Finalized:** 2025-10-14 01:45 UTC

### Changes Summary

**Files Modified:**
- `src/character/skeleton.h` - Added `set_joint_rotation()` function declaration and `<glm/gtc/quaternion.hpp>` include
- `src/character/skeleton.cpp` - Implemented `set_joint_rotation()` function and added required includes
- `src/character/keyframe.cpp` - Removed 2 duplicated `apply_joint` lambdas in `apply_pose()` and `apply_pose_with_overrides()`, replaced with calls to `set_joint_rotation()`
- `src/character/animation.cpp` - Removed `apply_blended_joint` lambda in `update_skeletal_animation()`, replaced with calls to `set_joint_rotation()`

**Impact:**
Successfully eliminated code duplication by extracting repeated joint rotation logic into a reusable utility function. Reduced codebase by ~26 lines of code, created single source of truth for joint rotation application, and improved maintainability. All 3 lambda duplications removed while preserving call-site-specific logic in appropriate local helpers.

### Backlog Updates

**Item Status:** Moved to Completed in IMPROVE_BACKLOG.md

**New Items Discovered:**
None

**Batch Opportunities Noted:**
None identified. The two remaining Medium items (Buffer Pruning Helper, Speed/Age Gradient Helpers) are in different subsystems with different patterns.

### Learnings

**What Worked Well:**
- Stage-by-stage execution with incremental builds caught the missing include immediately
- Pattern was clean—all 3 instances had identical logic with no variations
- Incremental compilation kept validation fast (1-2 files per stage)
- Plan accuracy was high—no deviations required

**What Was Harder Than Expected:**
- Initial build failure due to missing `<glm/gtc/quaternion.hpp>` include in header file
- Easily resolved by understanding glm header organization (type definitions must be in headers that use them)

**Insights for Future Work:**
- When extracting patterns involving external library types (glm, etc.), verify required includes in both header and implementation
- Pattern extraction with 3+ identical occurrences is low-risk and high-value
- Keep local helper lambdas when they encapsulate call-site logic (e.g., `blend_channel` for quaternion blending specific to animation)
- Document inline comments preserve context better than extracting overly generic utilities

**Time Estimate Accuracy:**
- Estimated: 3 complexity points / ~30 min
- Actual: 3 points / ~8 min (excluding review/finalization)
- Variance: Under estimate (faster than expected)
- Reason: Clean pattern, incremental builds, straightforward refactor
