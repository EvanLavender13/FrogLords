# Principle Review: Run Gait Blending

**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Status:** APPROVED

### Summary

Plans align strongly with core principles. Feature builds bottom-up on proven foundation (skeletal system, locomotion, 1D pose blending), maintains tight scope (bilinear slerp of existing content), and follows graybox-first discipline. Implementation plan correctly identifies system ownership, includes proper architecture review, and decomposes work into atomic steps. Certainty rating (85%) is realistic given stable dependencies. No violations detected. Ready to proceed.

### Violations (Must Fix)

**If none:** No violations found.

### Risks & Concerns

- **Walk_factor transition feel tuning:** Implementation plan acknowledges this (exponential smoothing added in Step 4). Architecture supports rapid iteration via debug toggles. Low risk.
  - **Mitigation:** Debug UI includes blend mode isolation (walk-only, run-only, mixed) and telemetry readouts. Smoothing parameter exposed for runtime tuning.

- **Quaternion hemisphere flips:** Plan preserves existing shortest-path handling via `glm::slerp`. No new quaternion logic introduced—reuses proven pattern from 1D blending.
  - **Mitigation:** Existing slerp infrastructure validated through prior iterations. Bilinear approach maintains per-joint consistency.

### Actionable Items

**If none:** Ready to proceed with implementation.

### Recommendation

**Reasoning:** Feature demonstrates exemplary adherence to development philosophy. Builds on 100% certain skeletal system and 95% certain locomotion foundation. Reuses proven patterns (distance-phased surveyor wheel, quaternion slerp) rather than inventing novel approaches. Graybox scope minimal (40-60 lines, existing content). Implementation plan includes architecture audit, migration strategy, and quality gates. Planning horizon appropriate (3 points, derivative work on stable foundation). Debug tooling prioritized for iteration velocity.

Specific alignment evidence:
- "Clarity over cleverness" - straightforward bilinear slerp, no exotic blending
- "Bottom-up dependency flow" - builds on completed skeletal/locomotion stack
- "Graybox first" - reuses authored run poses, no new content required
- "Million-repetition thinking" - smooth speed transitions critical for core loop
- "Matched scales" - uses existing walk_factor computed from speed thresholds
- "Dual-reference pattern" - walk_factor smoothing follows proven spring-damper approach

Secondary validation:
- Foundation Architecture Review (Step 0) explicitly checks for system duplication, ownership clarity, and migration needs
- No reactive layers overriding core logic (blending is pure presentation)
- No content restrictions introduced (poses authored, not generated)
- Test loop tight (minutes—toggle speeds, adjust parameters)

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed to IMPLEMENTATION_STEP
- Follow checklist in run_gait_blending_PLAN.md (Steps 0-5)
- Validate via debug UI blend mode isolation
- Self-test speed transitions before declaring complete
