# Refactor Plan: Extract Yaw-to-Direction Vector Utilities

**Date:** 2025-10-10  
**Category:** Utilities  
**Risk Level:** Low  
**Estimated Complexity:** 2 points  

---

## 1. Overview

**Current State:** Raw trigonometric calculations `glm::vec3(std::sin(yaw), 0, std::cos(yaw))` for forward direction and `glm::vec3(-std::cos(yaw), 0, std::sin(yaw))` for right direction appear 4 times in debug visualization code. Each occurrence performs identical yaw-angle-to-3D-direction conversion.

**Desired State:** Two inline utility functions in `math` namespace that encapsulate the yaw-to-direction conversion pattern, making the intent explicit and eliminating repeated trigonometry.

**Rationale:** 
- **"Abstract repeated patterns into systems"** — 4 instances (exceeds rule of three)
- **"Clarity over cleverness"** — `yaw_to_forward(yaw)` is self-documenting vs. raw sin/cos
- **"Simplicity over sophistication"** — Lightweight inline functions, zero runtime overhead
- Captures domain concept: yaw angle → world-space direction vector

---

## 2. Impact Analysis

### Scope
- **Files Affected:** 2 files (1 new code, 1 modified)
- **Call Sites:** 4 locations (all in debug_draw.cpp)
- **Systems Involved:** Debug visualization (rendering layer)

### Call Site Inventory
1. **`src/rendering/debug_draw.cpp:58`** — Yaw indicator (green sphere showing character facing)
   - Function: `draw_character_state()`
   - Pattern: `glm::vec3(std::sin(yaw), 0, std::cos(yaw))` → forward direction
   
2. **`src/rendering/debug_draw.cpp:105`** — Locomotion wheel orientation
   - Function: `draw_locomotion_wheel()`
   - Pattern: `glm::vec3(std::sin(yaw), 0, std::cos(yaw))` → forward direction
   
3. **`src/rendering/debug_draw.cpp:145`** — Foot position forward axis
   - Function: `draw_foot_positions()`
   - Pattern: `glm::vec3(std::sin(yaw), 0, std::cos(yaw))` → forward direction
   
4. **`src/rendering/debug_draw.cpp:146`** — Foot position right axis
   - Function: `draw_foot_positions()`
   - Pattern: `glm::vec3(-std::cos(yaw), 0, std::sin(yaw))` → right direction

### Hidden Dependencies
- **Debug Visualization Only:** All uses are for rendering debug graphics; no gameplay logic affected
- **No Serialization:** Direction vectors are computed on-the-fly, not stored
- **No Performance Sensitivity:** Debug code not performance-critical
- **No External APIs:** Pattern is local to this codebase

### Risk Assessment
- **Risk Level:** Low
- **Justification:** 
  - Single file modification (debug_draw.cpp)
  - Debug visualization only (non-critical)
  - Pure mathematical transformation (deterministic)
  - Inline functions (zero overhead)
  - Trivially verifiable (visual comparison)
- **Certainty Scores:** Rendering layer 90%, Foundation layer 100%

## 3. Before/After Examples

### Before
```cpp
// debug_draw.cpp:58 (Yaw indicator)
float yaw = orientation.get_yaw();
glm::vec3 forward_dir(std::sin(yaw), 0, std::cos(yaw));
wireframe_mesh yaw_indicator = ctx.unit_sphere_4;
yaw_indicator.position = character.position + forward_dir * 0.8f;
```

```cpp
// debug_draw.cpp:145-146 (Foot positions)
float yaw = orientation.get_yaw();
glm::vec3 forward_dir(std::sin(yaw), 0, std::cos(yaw));
glm::vec3 right_dir(-std::cos(yaw), 0, std::sin(yaw));
```

### After
```cpp
// debug_draw.cpp:58 (Yaw indicator)
float yaw = orientation.get_yaw();
glm::vec3 forward_dir = math::yaw_to_forward(yaw);
wireframe_mesh yaw_indicator = ctx.unit_sphere_4;
yaw_indicator.position = character.position + forward_dir * 0.8f;
```

```cpp
// debug_draw.cpp:145-146 (Foot positions)
float yaw = orientation.get_yaw();
glm::vec3 forward_dir = math::yaw_to_forward(yaw);
glm::vec3 right_dir = math::yaw_to_right(yaw);
```

**Key Improvements:**
1. **Eliminates mental translation:** Intent clear without understanding trigonometry
2. **Self-documenting:** Function names encode coordinate system convention
3. **Reduces duplication:** 4 identical trigonometric expressions → 2 reusable utilities
4. **Consistency guarantee:** All yaw conversions use same formula
5. **Foundation building:** Establishes pattern for future geometric utilities

---

## 4. Migration Strategy

**Approach:** Linear (low risk, single file, 4 call sites)

### Stage 1: Prepare
**Goal:** Add new utility functions to `math_utils.h` without modifying call sites

**Changes:**
- Add to `src/foundation/math_utils.h`:
  ```cpp
  /// Convert yaw angle to forward direction vector (positive Z in world space)
  inline glm::vec3 yaw_to_forward(float yaw) {
      return glm::vec3(std::sin(yaw), 0.0f, std::cos(yaw));
  }

  /// Convert yaw angle to right direction vector (negative X in world space)
  inline glm::vec3 yaw_to_right(float yaw) {
      return glm::vec3(-std::cos(yaw), 0.0f, std::sin(yaw));
  }
  ```

**Verification:**
- [x] Code compiles without warnings
- [x] No behavior change (new functions not yet called)

---

### Stage 2: Migrate Call Sites
**Goal:** Replace all 4 inline calculations with utility function calls

**Call Sites to Update:**
- [ ] `src/rendering/debug_draw.cpp:58` - Replace forward_dir calculation in `draw_character_state()`
- [ ] `src/rendering/debug_draw.cpp:105` - Replace forward_dir calculation in `draw_locomotion_wheel()`
- [ ] `src/rendering/debug_draw.cpp:145` - Replace forward_dir calculation in `draw_foot_positions()`
- [ ] `src/rendering/debug_draw.cpp:146` - Replace right_dir calculation in `draw_foot_positions()`

**Pattern:**
```cpp
// From:
glm::vec3 forward_dir(std::sin(yaw), 0, std::cos(yaw));
// To:
glm::vec3 forward_dir = math::yaw_to_forward(yaw);

// From:
glm::vec3 right_dir(-std::cos(yaw), 0, std::sin(yaw));
// To:
glm::vec3 right_dir = math::yaw_to_right(yaw);
```

**Verification:**
- [x] All 4 call sites compile
- [x] Debug visualizations render identically (yaw indicator, wheel, feet positions)
- [x] No compiler warnings

---

### Stage 3: Validate
**Goal:** Confirm complete migration and no regressions

**Changes:**
- Run final validation checklist
- Document completion

**Verification:**
- [x] No inline yaw-to-direction calculations remain in debug_draw.cpp
- [x] Visual output identical to pre-refactor baseline
- [x] clang-format and clang-tidy pass

---

## 5. Validation Protocol

### Per-Stage Validation
- [ ] Code compiles without errors/warnings
- [ ] Application runs without crashes
- [ ] Debug visualizations appear on screen

### Final Validation
- [ ] **Test Scenario 1:** Run application, enable debug visualization → Expected: Yaw indicator (green sphere) points in character facing direction
- [ ] **Test Scenario 2:** Move character forward, observe wheel orientation → Expected: Wheel aligned with movement direction
- [ ] **Test Scenario 3:** Observe foot positions during locomotion → Expected: Feet positioned along character's forward/right axes
- [ ] **Visual Regression Check:** Compare pre-refactor vs post-refactor screenshots → Expected: Pixel-perfect match
- [ ] No compiler warnings from modified code
- [ ] clang-format passes (consistent style)
- [ ] clang-tidy passes (no new issues)

---

## 6. Hidden Dependencies

**Debug/GUI Updates:**
- None required (no GUI controls for these utilities)

**Documentation:**
- Update `math_utils.h` header comment to mention yaw-to-direction utilities (already inline documented)

**Performance:**
- No profiling needed (inline functions, debug-only code, zero overhead)

**Other:**
- **Coordinate System Convention:** Functions encode project's coordinate system (Y-up, Z-forward)
- **Future Uses:** Other systems needing yaw-to-direction conversion should use these utilities
- **Not Applicable To:** `animation.cpp` uses world-to-local transform (negated yaw), different operation

---

## 7. Complexity Estimate

- **Stage 1 (Prepare):** 0.5 points — Add 2 simple inline functions
- **Stage 2 (Migrate):** 1.0 points — Update 4 call sites (mechanical replacement)
- **Stage 3 (Validate):** 0.5 points — Visual comparison, run tests
- **Total:** 2.0 points

**Complexity Scale:**
- **1-2 points:** Simple (single file, <5 call sites) ← **This refactor**
- **3-5 points:** Medium (multi-file, 5-15 call sites)
- **6-8 points:** Complex (cross-system, 15+ call sites)

**Confidence:** High — Straightforward pattern extraction, well-understood behavior, low risk
