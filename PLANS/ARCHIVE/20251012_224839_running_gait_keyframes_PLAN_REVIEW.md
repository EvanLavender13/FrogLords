# Principle Review: Running Gait Keyframes

**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Status:** APPROVED

## Changelog

- **2025-10-13 (Initial Review):** Plans approved with minor notes about deferred walk rename
- **2025-10-13 (Re-review after MODIFY_PLAN):** Walk enum rename un-deferred per user request and included in feature scope. Misalignment resolved. Actionable items updated.

### Summary

Plans are well-aligned with core principles. This feature represents a straightforward extension of proven quaternion keyframe architecture (100% certainty) to add running gait poses. The scope appropriately includes renaming existing walk poses for consistency (`STEP_LEFT/NEUTRAL/STEP_RIGHT` → `WALK_REACH_LEFT/WALK_PASS_RIGHT/WALK_REACH_RIGHT` + new `WALK_PASS_LEFT`) plus 4 new run keyframes. Implementation correctly builds on stable foundation (skeletal animation stack validated through 8 completed iterations), uses tight graybox loop (manual pose selection + joint overrides), and defers blending/automation to future iterations. Architecture audit confirms single system ownership with no duplicates. No violations detected.

### Violations (Must Fix)

**If none:** No violations found.

### Misalignments & Risks

- **Run Keyframe Cycle Order Clarity:** FEATURE.md specifies cycle order `REACH_LEFT → PASS_RIGHT → REACH_RIGHT → PASS_LEFT`, but PLAN.md's UI section uses generic "cycle order" without reiterating the sequence.
  - **Mitigation:** Already minor—FEATURE.md is clear. During implementation, verify that pose_names[] array order in character_panel.cpp matches the FEATURE.md cycle sequence to avoid confusion during manual testing.

**If none:** Plans appear well-aligned.

### Actionable Items

- [ ] During implementation: double-check pose_names[] array order in character_panel.cpp matches FEATURE.md cycle sequence (`REACH_LEFT`, `PASS_RIGHT`, `REACH_RIGHT`, `PASS_LEFT`).
- [ ] Update automatic animation's current-pose display switch in animation.cpp to use renamed enum values (if display is still needed—currently manual-only testing).

**If none:** Ready to proceed with implementation.
