# Encapsulate Controller Subsystems

## The Violation
**Principle:** Composable Functions (leaky abstraction)
**Files:**
- `src/app/game_world.cpp:56` - Direct orientation update
- `src/app/game_world.cpp:58-60` - Direct animation update and flag management

**Current:**
```cpp
// game_world.cpp:54-60
glm::vec3 intended_velocity = character.input_direction * character.max_speed;

character.orientation.update(intended_velocity, dt);

character.animation.update_landing_spring(character.just_landed,
                                          character.vertical_velocity_on_land, dt);
character.just_landed = false;
```

**Problem:**
- `game_world` reaches into `controller`'s internal subsystems (`orientation`, `animation`)
- `game_world` manages `controller`'s state flag (`just_landed`)
- Violates encapsulation: controller should manage its own reactive systems
- Creates coupling between game_world and controller internals

## The Solution
**Approach:** Simplify

**Change:**
1. Add `controller::update_reactive_systems(float dt)` method
2. Move orientation and animation updates into controller
3. Remove direct subsystem access from game_world
4. Controller manages its own `just_landed` flag lifecycle

**Implementation:**
```cpp
// controller.h - Add public method
void update_reactive_systems(float dt);

// controller.cpp - New method
void controller::update_reactive_systems(float dt) {
    // Calculate intended velocity for orientation system
    glm::vec3 intended_velocity = input_direction * max_speed;
    orientation.update(intended_velocity, dt);

    // Update animation reactive systems
    animation.update_landing_spring(just_landed, vertical_velocity_on_land, dt);

    // Manage landing flag lifecycle
    just_landed = false;
}

// game_world.cpp - Simplified call
character.update_reactive_systems(dt);
```

**Result:**
- game_world no longer knows about controller internals
- controller encapsulates all its subsystem management
- Single point of responsibility for reactive system updates
- Easier to understand controller update flow

## The Justification
**Why Now:**
- Foundation certainty is 90% (above threshold)
- Simple encapsulation with clear responsibility boundary
- Low risk, high clarity improvement
- Natural batching of two related violations

**Dependencies:**
- `controller::update()` must remain stable (already at 90% certainty)
- `orientation` and `animation` subsystems must remain stable (both clean)
- No other systems directly access these subsystems

**Risk:** Low
- Pure encapsulation move, no logic changes
- All data remains accessible for debugging
- Single call site in game_world makes verification trivial

## The Measure
**Before:**
- 2 subsystem calls + 1 flag management = 3 lines of coupling
- game_world knows about `orientation`, `animation`, `just_landed`, `vertical_velocity_on_land`, `input_direction`, `max_speed`
- 6 controller internals exposed to game_world

**After:**
- 1 encapsulated method call = 1 line
- game_world knows only about `controller` interface
- 1 public method exposed

**Test:**
1. Build succeeds
2. Character orientation still updates when moving
3. Landing spring animation still triggers on landing
4. No behavioral changes observed in gameplay

Complexity: 3 points
Certainty: 95% (pure encapsulation, well-understood pattern)

## EXECUTION

**Path:** Standard (3 points)
**Executed:** 2025-10-16
**Duration:** ~5 minutes

### Stages Completed

#### Stage 1: Add Method Declaration ✓
**File:** `src/character/controller.h:72`
**Change:** Added `void update_reactive_systems(float dt);` declaration
**Validation:** Build ✓

#### Stage 2: Implement Method ✓
**File:** `src/character/controller.cpp:131-141`
**Change:** Implemented encapsulation method containing:
- Intended velocity calculation for orientation
- Orientation system update
- Animation landing spring update
- Landing flag lifecycle management
**Validation:** Build ✓

#### Stage 3: Simplify Call Site ✓
**File:** `src/app/game_world.cpp:54`
**Change:** Replaced 7 lines of direct subsystem access with single method call
**Validation:** Build ✓ Behavior ✓

### Complexity Reduction

**Before:**
- game_world.cpp: 7 lines exposing 6 controller internals
- Coupling: `orientation`, `animation`, `just_landed`, `vertical_velocity_on_land`, `input_direction`, `max_speed`

**After:**
- game_world.cpp: 1 line calling encapsulated interface
- Coupling: `update_reactive_systems()` method only
- controller.h: +1 line (declaration)
- controller.cpp: +10 lines (implementation)

**Net Change:**
- Lines in game_world: -6 (simplified)
- Lines in controller: +11 (encapsulation added)
- Total: +5 lines (acceptable - encapsulation justifies growth)
- **Coupling reduced: 6 internals → 1 interface (83% reduction)**

### Principle Restoration

1. **Composability: RESTORED** ✓
   - Controller now encapsulates its own subsystems
   - game_world no longer knows about controller internals
   - Clear responsibility boundary established

2. **Simplicity: IMPROVED** ✓
   - game_world simplified (7 lines → 1 line)
   - Single method call replaces multi-step procedure
   - Easier to understand update flow

3. **Other Principles: MAINTAINED** ✓
   - No mathematical changes
   - No behavior changes
   - No consistency violations introduced

### Validation

- Build: ✓ Succeeds
- Behavior: ✓ Unchanged (orientation updates, landing spring works)
- Encapsulation: ✓ game_world no longer accesses controller internals
- No regressions detected

**The system is simpler and better encapsulated.**

## FINALIZATION

**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Path:** B (Standard - 3 points)
**Duration:** ~5 minutes

### Simplification Summary
- Coupling reduced: 6 controller internals → 1 clean interface (83% reduction)
- game_world simplified: 7 lines → 1 line
- Net code change: +5 lines (justified - encapsulation added to proper owner)
- Principle restored: Composable Functions (encapsulation)

### Files Modified
- `src/character/controller.h:72` - Added method declaration
- `src/character/controller.cpp:131-141` - Implemented encapsulation method
- `src/app/game_world.cpp:54` - Replaced direct access with encapsulated call

### Pattern Identified
**Name:** Leaky Abstraction / Responsibility Diffusion

**Recognition Signs:**
- Higher-level system managing lower-level system's internal state
- Direct access to subsystems bypassing proper interfaces
- State flag lifecycle split across system boundaries
- "Reactive" or "secondary" systems updated outside their owner

**Resolution Pattern:**
- Create explicit update phase for reactive systems
- Move all reactive logic to owning system
- Provide single encapsulated interface
- Manage flag lifecycles internally

**Where Else:** None found in current codebase (pattern now eliminated)

### Learnings

**What Worked:**
- Simple encapsulation - move code to where it belongs
- Single method call replaced complex orchestration
- Clear responsibility boundary

**What Was Challenging:**
- None - straightforward refactoring
- Pattern was obvious once identified

**What to Remember:**
- Reactive systems belong to the entity they react to
- External orchestration of internals is a code smell
- Encapsulation justifies adding lines if coupling reduces dramatically
- Trust the principles - they guide toward simplicity

### Impact on Foundation

**Before:** 90% certainty
**After:** 92% certainty
- Architectural clarity improved
- Coupling reduced
- Responsibilities clarified

### New Violations Found
None discovered during this improvement.

### Backlog Status
- Removed: 2 medium priority items (batched as this improvement)
- Added: 0 new items
- Remaining: 1 high priority (unused headers), 1 low priority (documentation)

**The codebase is simpler. The principles are stronger. Encapsulation restored.**
