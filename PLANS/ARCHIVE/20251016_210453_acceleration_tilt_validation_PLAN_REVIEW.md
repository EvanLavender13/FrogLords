# Plan Review: Acceleration Tilt Math Validation

**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Status:** APPROVED

## Summary
The plan to create an isolated validation suite for the acceleration tilt math is excellent. It directly follows the successful and recently proven `quaternion_validation` pattern, aligning perfectly with the core development principle of "validate novel math/data structures in isolation first." The scope is appropriately limited to pure mathematical correctness, the implementation details are clear, and the risk is extremely low. This feature will increase confidence in the character animation foundation and provide a strong safety net for future refactoring.

## Violations (Must Fix)
- **None.** The plan is in full alignment with all development principles outlined in `AGENTS.md`.

## Risks & Concerns
- **Risk:** Minimal. The only potential risk is introducing a build break, but the plan includes quality gates to verify the build with the test flag both ON and OFF.
  - **Mitigation:** The plan's quality gates are sufficient.

## Actionable Items
- [ ] Proceed with implementation as outlined in `PLANS/acceleration_tilt_validation_PLAN.md`.

## Recommendation
**Reasoning:** The plan is a textbook example of applying established, successful patterns to improve codebase quality and developer confidence. It is a direct, low-cost, high-value implementation of the project's core principles.
**Next Steps:** Proceed to implementation.
