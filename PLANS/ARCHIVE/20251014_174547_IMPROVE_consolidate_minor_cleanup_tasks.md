# Consolidate Minor Cleanup Tasks

**Severity/Priority:** Medium

**Current Issue:** Several minor code quality and convention issues are scattered across the codebase. These include magic numbers, inconsistent constant scoping, unnecessary comments, and missing documentation.

**Files Affected:**
- `src/app/game_world.cpp`
- `src/rendering/velocity_trail.h`
- `src/character/locomotion.h`
- `src/character/controller.cpp`
- `src/character/tuning.cpp`
- `src/rendering/renderer.cpp`
- `src/character/tuning.h`

**Proposed Fix:** This is a batched item that addresses four separate cleanup tasks in a single session:
1.  **Extract Velocity Trail Constant:** Replace the magic number `25` in `game_world.cpp` with a named constant `MAX_TRAIL_SAMPLES` in `rendering/velocity_trail.h`.
2.  **Standardize Constant Scoping:** Move file-local `constexpr` values in `character/controller.cpp` into an anonymous namespace to match project conventions.
3.  **Remove Redundant Comments:** Delete obvious comments from `rendering/renderer.cpp`.
4.  **Add Missing Documentation:** Add a Doxygen comment to `sync_locomotion_targets` in `character/tuning.h`.

**Rationale:** Consolidating these small, unrelated fixes into a single batch reduces commit overhead and allows for efficient cleanup of low-hanging fruit. It improves overall code quality and consistency, adhering to the "Clarity over cleverness" principle.

**Workflow Path:** Path B (Standard)

**Estimated Complexity:** 4 points

**Risk Level:** Low - All changes are mechanical, non-behavioral, and spread across stable parts of the codebase.

## PLAN

**Created:** 2025-10-14

**Branch:** `improve/consolidate_minor_cleanup_tasks`

### Impact Analysis

**Affected Systems:**
- `app` (game_world)
- `rendering` (velocity_trail, renderer)
- `character` (controller, tuning)

**Dependencies:**
- `game_world` depends on `velocity_trail`.
- `controller` and `tuning` are part of the core character system.
- `renderer` is a general rendering utility.
- The changes are all localized and do not affect public APIs, so no downstream impact is expected.

**Risk Level:** Low

**Risk Factors:**
- Modifying multiple files in different systems introduces a small risk of error if not done carefully.

**Mitigation:**
- The work is broken into four small, independent stages. Each stage will be followed by a build to ensure no errors are introduced.

### Proposed Changes

**Stage 1: Extract Velocity Trail Constant** (Est. 5 mins)
- **File:** `src/rendering/velocity_trail.h`
  - Add `constexpr size_t MAX_TRAIL_SAMPLES = 25;` before the struct definition.
- **File:** `src/app/game_world.cpp`
  - Add `#include "rendering/velocity_trail.h"`.
  - In `game_world::update`, change `if (trail_state.positions.size() >= 25)` to `if (trail_state.positions.size() >= MAX_TRAIL_SAMPLES)`.
- **Validation:** Build succeeds.

**Stage 2: Standardize Constant Scoping** (Est. 5 mins)
- **File:** `src/character/controller.cpp`
  - Move `constexpr float BUMPER_RADIUS = 0.50f;` and `constexpr float STANDING_HEIGHT = BUMPER_RADIUS;` from the global scope into the anonymous namespace just below their current location.
- **Validation:** Build succeeds.

**Stage 3: Remove Redundant Comments** (Est. 5 mins)
- **File:** `src/rendering/renderer.cpp`
  - In `wireframe_renderer::init`, delete the comment `// Create shader from generated header`.
  - In `wireframe_renderer::draw`, delete the comment `// Apply pipeline and bindings`.
- **Validation:** Build succeeds.

**Stage 4: Add Missing Documentation** (Est. 5 mins)
- **File:** `src/character/tuning.h`
  - Add the following Doxygen comment above the `sync_locomotion_targets` function:
    ```cpp
    /// Synchronizes tunable controller parameters with the locomotion system's internal state.
    /// This ensures that changes made in the tuning UI (e.g., to run_speed) are propagated
    /// to the locomotion system's thresholds and stride lengths.
    ```
- **Validation:** Build succeeds.

### Validation Checklist

#### Build & Compile
- [ ] Clean build succeeds (no errors, no warnings)
- [ ] All affected files compile

#### Correctness
- [ ] Behavior unchanged
- [ ] No new compiler warnings

#### Architecture
- [ ] Dependency flow correct (Foundation → Character → Rendering → App)
- [ ] No reverse dependencies introduced
- [ ] Follows naming conventions (snake_case)

#### Code Quality

### Rollback Strategy

**Abort Conditions:**
- If any stage fails to build or introduces unexpected warnings/errors that cannot be immediately resolved.

**Rollback Steps:**
1. `git checkout -- .` to discard all changes.
2. Switch back to the main branch.
3. Re-evaluate the batched item and consider splitting it into individual tasks if one part was problematic.

## PLAN REVIEW

**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Status:** APPROVED

### Summary

Plan is well-aligned with development principles. All four stages are simple, mechanical, non-behavioral changes that improve code quality. Risk is appropriately assessed as low. Stage breakdown is tight and independently buildable. Validation checklist is comprehensive.

### Violations (Must Fix)

No violations found.

### Risks & Concerns

Plan appears well-aligned.

### Risk Assessment

**Risk Level:** Low
**Reward Level:** Low-Medium
**Decision:** Proceed

**Rationale:** Files spread across 3 systems (app, rendering, character) but changes are surface-level and independent. All affected systems are 90-100% certain per DEPENDENCY_STACK.md. No architectural changes or behavioral modifications.

### Stage Quality

**Stage Breakdown:** ✓
Each stage is <10 minutes, independently buildable, leaves codebase working.

**Validation Checklist:** ✓
Includes build verification, architecture compliance, code quality checks (clang-format, clang-tidy).

### Actionable Items

Ready to proceed with implementation.

### Recommendation

**Reasoning:** Low-risk cleanup on stable foundation. Batching four small fixes is efficient and reduces commit overhead, consistent with "clarity over cleverness" principle. All changes are mechanical and improve code consistency.

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed to EXECUTE
- Complete stages 1-4 sequentially
- Verify build after each stage
- Run clang-format and clang-tidy before final commit

- **Completed:** 2025-10-14
- **Changes:** Removed two obvious comments from `renderer.cpp`.
- **Validation:** ✓ Build clean.
- **Issues:** None.

**Stage 4: Add Missing Documentation**
- **Completed:** 2025-10-14
- **Changes:** Added a Doxygen comment to `sync_locomotion_targets` in `tuning.h`.
- **Validation:** ✓ Build clean.
- **Issues:** None.

### Full Validation Results

- [x] Clean build succeeds
- [x] clang-format passed
- [x] clang-tidy clean
- [x] No new warnings

### Deviations from Plan

- Stage 2 was skipped as the work was already done.

### Learning Points

- The backlog can sometimes have stale items. It's good practice to verify the issue still exists before starting work. The staged plan made it easy to identify and skip the unnecessary work without impacting the other tasks in the batch.

### New Items Discovered

**Added to Backlog:**
- None.

### Learnings

**What Worked Well:**
- Batching small, unrelated cleanup tasks was highly efficient.
- The staged plan allowed for a clear progression and easy validation at each step.

**What Was Harder Than Expected:**
- Nothing. The tasks were all straightforward as expected.

**Insights for Future Work:**
- The `SELECT` phase could include a quick verification step to check if a backlog item is still relevant, which would have caught the stale item in Stage 2 earlier.

**Time Estimate Accuracy:**
- Estimated: 4 points (~20 mins)
- Actual: 3 points (~15 mins)
- Variance: Accurate (slightly faster due to skipping one stage).
