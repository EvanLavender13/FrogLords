# Y-Axis Up Vector Constant

**Current State:** `glm::vec3(0, 1, 0)` and `glm::vec3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f)` literals appear 14 times across core gameplay, rendering, and foundation code to express the world up axis.

**Proposed Change:** Introduce a `math::UP` constexpr in `src/foundation/math_utils.h` and replace the existing literals at all call sites with the named constant.

**Affected Systems:** `src/foundation/math_utils.h`; `src/character/controller.cpp`; `src/character/animation.cpp`; `src/foundation/collision.cpp`; `src/rendering/debug_draw.cpp`; `src/rendering/wireframe.cpp`; `src/camera/camera.cpp`; `src/camera/camera.h`.

**Rationale:** Satisfies the rule-of-three (14 verified uses) while improving clarity by documenting the project's Y-up convention. Keeps the stable core gameplay layer (95% certainty in `DEPENDENCY_STACK.md`) consistent and reduces future maintenance cost if coordinate assumptions shift. Aligns with "Clarity over cleverness" and "Wait for third use" principles by extracting only after repeated use.

**Estimated Complexity:** 2 points

**Risk Level:** Low — pure constant substitution in stable systems with no behavioral change expected.

## Refactor Plan

**Date:** 2025-10-11  
**Risk Level:** Low  
**Estimated Complexity:** 2 points

### Impact Analysis

**Scope:**
- **Files Affected:** 8 (`math_utils.h` plus 7 implementation files)
- **Call Sites:** 14
- **Systems Involved:** Foundation (math_utils, collision), Character (controller, animation), Camera, Rendering (debug_draw, wireframe)

**Call Site Inventory:**
- `src/character/controller.cpp:156` – Yaw rotation uses literal up axis
- `src/character/controller.cpp:191` – Ground contact normal literal
- `src/character/controller.cpp:196` – Collision debug normal literal
- `src/character/animation.cpp:262` – Shoulder spring axis literal
- `src/character/animation.cpp:265` – Shoulder spring axis literal
- `src/foundation/collision.cpp:41` – Sphere/AABB normal fallback literal
- `src/rendering/debug_draw.cpp:244` – Debug transform yaw rotation literal
- `src/rendering/wireframe.cpp:20` – Wireframe mesh Y-rotation axis literal
- `src/rendering/wireframe.cpp:202` – Arrow perpendicular fallback literal
- `src/rendering/wireframe.cpp:273` - Spring fallback axis literal
- `src/camera/camera.cpp:69` - Camera right vector cross product literal
- `src/camera/camera.h:94` - Camera default up vector literal
- `src/character/controller.cpp:26` - Controller default ground normal
- `src/rendering/debug_draw.cpp:114` - Wheel up-axis helper vector

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Level:** Low
- **Justification:** Pure data substitution within 95%+ certainty systems; no behavioral math changes beyond referencing a named constant.
- **Certainty Scores:** Character Controller 95%, Camera 95%, Rendering Debug 100%, Foundation Collision 100% (`PLANS/DEPENDENCY_STACK.md`)

### Before/After Examples

**Before:**
```cpp
transform = glm::rotate(transform, yaw, glm::vec3(0, 1, 0));
```

**After:**
```cpp
transform = glm::rotate(transform, yaw, math::UP);
```

**Key Improvements:**
- Documents and reinforces the global Y-up convention with a named constant.
- Provides a single point of change if world orientation needs adjustment later.
- Removes repeated literals, reducing the risk of typos or inconsistent updates.

### Migration Strategy

**Approach:** Linear (two-pass)

**Stage 1: Prepare**
- **Goal:** Introduce shared constant without altering behavior.
- **Changes:** Add `math::UP` constexpr to `math_utils.h`; include header where absent.
- **Verification:**
  - [x] Project compiles (no include regressions)
  - [x] `rg` confirms new constant available

**Stage 2: Migrate**
- **Goal:** Replace literals with `math::UP`.
- **Call Sites:**
  - [x] `src/character/controller.cpp:156`
  - [x] `src/character/controller.cpp:191`
  - [x] `src/character/controller.cpp:196`
  - [x] `src/character/animation.cpp:262`
  - [x] `src/character/animation.cpp:265`
  - [x] `src/foundation/collision.cpp:41`
  - [x] `src/rendering/debug_draw.cpp:244`
  - [x] `src/rendering/wireframe.cpp:20`
  - [x] `src/rendering/wireframe.cpp:202`
  - [x] `src/rendering/wireframe.cpp:273`
  - [x] `src/camera/camera.cpp:69`
  - [x] `src/camera/camera.h:94`
  - [x] `src/character/controller.cpp:26` (constructor default normal)
  - [x] `src/rendering/debug_draw.cpp:114` (wheel up axis helper)
- **Verification:**
  - [x] `rg "glm::vec3(0, 1, 0)" src` returns no remaining up-axis literals
  - [x] Build succeeds

**Stage 3: Cleanup**
- **Goal:** Ensure no redundant literals or headers remain.
- **Changes:** Remove any incidental redundant includes introduced during migration.
- **Verification:**
  - [x] Final `rg --line-number "vec3(0, 1, 0)" src` shows only deliberate non-up uses
  - [x] Diff limited to intended files

### Validation Protocol

**Per-Stage:**
- [x] Compiles without errors/warnings
- [x] Editor `rg` scan verifies constant adoption

**Final:**
- [x] Launch playback build and confirm character orientation and yaw rotation behave identically
- [x] Observe wireframe debug arrows/springs render correctly
- [x] Confirm collision debug normals still point upward when grounded
- [x] No performance warnings or build regressions

### Hidden Dependencies

- **Debug/GUI:** None (interfaces already include math utilities)
- **Documentation:** No updates required beyond this plan
- **Performance:** No impact (constexpr constant)

### Complexity Breakdown

- Stage 1: 1 point – Add constant + includes
- Stage 2: 1 point - Replace literals across call sites
- Stage 3: 0 points - Sanity check / cleanup
- Validation: 0 points - Compile + manual spot checks embedded above
- **Total:** 2 points

## Execution Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-11  
**Approach Used:** Linear

**Files Modified:**
- `src/foundation/math_utils.h` - Added `math::UP` constant documenting Y-up convention.
- `src/character/controller.cpp` - Replaced up-axis literals (including constructor default) with `math::UP`.
- `src/character/animation.cpp` - Swapped shoulder secondary-motion axes to `math::UP`.
- `src/foundation/collision.cpp` - Used `math::UP` for sphere/AABB fallback normal and pulled in math utilities.
- `src/rendering/debug_draw.cpp` - Switched yaw rotation and wheel helper to `math::UP`.
- `src/rendering/wireframe.cpp` - Centralized Y-axis rotation and fallback vectors via `math::UP`.
- `src/camera/camera.cpp` - Used `math::UP` when deriving right vector.
- `src/camera/camera.h` - Initialized camera up vector from `math::UP`.
- `PLANS/refactor_y_axis_up_vector_constant.md` - Tracked plan progress and execution notes.

**Issues Encountered:**
- Located two additional up-axis literals (`controller` constructor and debug wheel helper) that were missed by the initial pattern scan; added them to the plan and migrated in the same pass.

**Deviations from Plan:**
- Call site inventory expanded from 12 to 14 to capture the newly discovered literals; otherwise followed the planned linear migration.

### Code Quality Standards

**Naming:** ✔ Correct  
**Formatting:** ✔ Consistent  
**Organization:** ✔ Correct  
**Documentation:** ✔ Adequate

**Issues:** None.

### Principle Alignment
