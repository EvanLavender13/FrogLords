## Speed-Based Animation Scaling (2025-10-06)

**Reason:** Premature feature without evidence of need

**Key Learning:** Test-first principle applies to features, not just bugs. "May not be necessary" intuitions deserve investigation before planning entire iterations. Current system working well is evidence to preserve, not improve speculatively.

**Principle Reinforced:** "Paradox of quality: accept temporary roughness early to maximize iteration count" and "Test before building"
