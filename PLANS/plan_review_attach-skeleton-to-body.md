# Principle Review: Attach Skeleton to Character Body

## Review History

**2025-10-06 (Second Review):** Plan modified via MODIFY_PLAN to expand scope. Added orientation (yaw rotation) and reactive animation transforms (landing spring vertical offset, acceleration tilt) to skeleton root. Re-reviewed to validate alignment with principles.

---

### 1. Summary

The plans remain well-aligned with core principles after scope expansion. This is still a minimal, bottom-up feature building on proven foundations (Skeleton Debug System at 100%, Character Controller at 95%, Reactive Animation Layer at 100%). The expanded graybox scope is appropriately simple—a single line of code reusing the existing `get_world_transform()` method that already includes position, orientation, and reactive offsets. The scope addition is justified: it ensures visual consistency between the skeleton and debug body box, and demonstrates the reactive animation layer working with the skeletal system. Planning horizon remains appropriate (few hours, ~95% certain). No violations found.

### 2. Violations & Contradictions

None identified. The plans follow the principles correctly.

### 3. Misalignments & Risks

**Resolved: Transform Hierarchy Clarified**
- **Source:** `PLANS/implementation_attach-skeleton-to-body.md` (updated)
- **Previous Concern:** Original review noted potential offset issues and lack of clarity about transform hierarchy
- **Resolution:** The updated implementation plan now clearly states the skeleton will use `character.get_world_transform()`, which already includes the full transform hierarchy: position → orientation → reactive offsets (tilt/spring). This matches the debug body box exactly.
- **Status:** Risk eliminated by scope expansion. The skeleton will automatically mirror all reactive animations.

**Positive: Reuse Over Duplication**
- **Source:** `PLANS/implementation_attach-skeleton-to-body.md`
- **Principle:** "Abstract repeated patterns into systems; prefer parameters over assets"
- **Details:** The updated plan leverages existing `get_world_transform()` method instead of duplicating position/rotation/offset logic. This is a single source of truth for the character's visual transform, ensuring skeleton and debug body stay synchronized automatically.
- **Impact:** Future changes to reactive animation (e.g., new tilt behavior) will automatically apply to both debug body and skeleton without additional code.

**Positive: Scope Expansion Justified**
- **Source:** `PLANS/iteration_attach-skeleton-to-body.md` changelog
- **Principle:** "Iteration over planning" / "Knowledge Creation > Implementation"
- **Details:** The scope addition (orientation + reactive transforms) was added based on a concrete need: visual consistency between skeleton and debug body. The rationale is documented in the iteration plan changelog. The expansion doesn't add complexity (still one line of code) and actually simplifies future work by establishing transform hierarchy from the start.
- **Note:** This demonstrates proper scope modification: identified need → documented rationale → minimal implementation expansion → preserved certainty.

### 4. Actionable Items

- [ ] Verify `controller.h::get_world_transform()` exists and is public before implementation
- [ ] Implement skeleton attachment: `t_pose_skeleton.joints[0].local_transform = character.get_world_transform();`
- [ ] Visual verification: Confirm skeleton moves, rotates, tilts, and springs identically to debug body box
- [ ] Document actual iteration time in post-implementation review (calibration data for future certainty estimates)

### 5. Principles Validation Checklist

**Core Tenets:**
- ✅ **Clarity over cleverness:** Single line of code, reuses existing transform method
- ✅ **Simplicity over sophistication:** No new abstractions, direct assignment
- ✅ **Iteration over planning:** Very short horizon (hours), appropriate for high certainty
- ✅ **Graybox before polish:** No art assets, pure functionality

**Procedural Foundation (Layering):**
- ✅ **Core logic inviolable:** Transform logic already proven in controller
- ✅ **Reactive systems interpret state:** Skeleton becomes reactive layer consumer
- ✅ **Polish deferred:** Visual-only change, no mechanics impact

**Dependencies & Uncertainty:**
- ✅ **Bottom-up:** Builds on 100% certain Skeleton Debug System and 95% certain Character Controller
- ✅ **Certainty appropriate:** 95% is realistic for this trivial integration
- ✅ **Dependency stack placement:** Correctly positioned above Skeleton Debug, below Secondary Motion

**Iteration & Planning Horizon:**
- ✅ **Short horizon:** Hours, not days—matches high certainty
- ✅ **Tight loop:** Immediate visual feedback, self-test sufficient
- ✅ **Paradox of quality:** Accepts T-pose skeleton as roughness, focuses on connection

**Graybox First:**
- ✅ **No premature production:** Uses existing T-pose, no art added
- ✅ **Useful test data:** Visual confirmation of transform hierarchy working

**Development Directives:**
- ✅ **Bottom-up work order:** Respects dependency stack
- ✅ **Single source of truth:** Reuses `get_world_transform()` instead of duplicating logic
- ✅ **No content restrictions:** Doesn't constrain future design
- ✅ **Maximize interactions:** Unblocks secondary motion, IK, future animation

### 6. Conclusion

The updated plans successfully incorporate the scope expansion while maintaining alignment with core principles. The decision to include orientation and reactive transforms is well-justified and actually improves the implementation by establishing a single source of truth for the character's visual transform. The implementation remains minimal (one line of code) and the certainty score remains appropriate (~95%).

**Key Improvements from Scope Modification:**
- Eliminates future drift between skeleton and debug body transforms
- Demonstrates reactive animation layer working with skeletal system from day one
- Reduces future maintenance (one transform method serves both systems)
- Documents transform hierarchy explicitly (position → orient → offset → tilt)

**Approval Status:** ✅ Proceed with implementation as planned. The scope expansion strengthens the feature without adding risk.
