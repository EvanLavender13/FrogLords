# Design Backlog

**Purpose:** Unordered, liquid reservoir of ideas not being worked on soon. Most ideas go here until the foundation solidifies enough to support them.

**Status:** Living document (updated continuously)

## Animation & Feel

### Reactive Animation (High Priority - Pull Next)
- **Spring-damper landings:** Detect airborne→grounded transition, apply impulse proportional to fall velocity, drive crouch/recover
  - *Prerequisite:* Visible character body (not just sphere)
  - *Certainty:* Medium (~60%) - simple system, but rendering dependency unclear
- **Secondary motion:** Bone "softness" parameters for wobble, follow-through on limbs
  - *Prerequisite:* Skeletal system with joints
  - *Certainty:* Low (~30%) - rendering approach unknown
- **Speed-based animation scaling:** Tilt magnitude/bounce height scale with velocity (like surveyor wheel physics)
  - *Prerequisite:* Acceleration tilt working
  - *Certainty:* Medium (~50%) - simple extension

### Advanced Animation (Low Priority)
- **Wall slide/run detection:** "Solving for stupid" - when face-first into wall, transition to wall run
- **Active ragdoll:** Spring-driven pose matching for dynamic reactions
- **Contextual poses:** Different arm positions for climbing, hanging, bracing
- **Flip/roll animations:** Manufactured momentum with anticipation curves
- **IK for interactions:** Hands reach for ledges, feet step on obstacles

## Movement & Physics

### Character Abilities (Medium Priority)
- **Dash/dodge:** Short burst of velocity in input direction
- **Wall jump:** Jump off walls when grounded against them
- **Ledge grab:** Detect ledge collision, IK hands to edge
- **Climbing:** Vertical movement on climbable surfaces
- **Swimming:** Buoyancy, drag, different movement rules
- **Crouching:** Lower collision height, slower movement

### Physics Enhancements (Low Priority)
- **Velocity inheritance:** Jumping off moving platform adds platform velocity
- **Slope physics:** Slide down steep slopes, gain speed
- **Wind/current forces:** Environmental forces affecting movement
- **Momentum preservation:** Bunny hopping, air strafing
- **Dual-sphere experiment:** Restore bumper + weightlifter system (currently single sphere)

## Combat & Interaction

### Combat Mechanics (Uncertain - Defer)
- **Melee attacks:** Punch, kick, grapple
- **Ranged attacks:** Throw objects, projectiles
- **Enemy AI:** Patrol, chase, attack patterns
- **Damage/health:** Hit points, death state
- **Impact reactions:** Knockback, stagger, ragdoll on death

### Interaction Systems (Uncertain - Defer)
- **Object pickup:** Grab and carry physics objects
- **Throwing:** Apply velocity to held objects
- **Doors/buttons:** Simple triggered interactions
- **Inventory:** Hold multiple items

## World & Environment

### Terrain (Low-Medium Priority)
- **Heightmap terrain:** Procedural ground with elevation
- **Uneven surfaces:** IK foot placement becomes necessary here
- **Moving platforms:** Elevators, rotating platforms
- **Destructible objects:** Break on impact
- **Water volumes:** Swimming areas

### Level Elements (Medium Priority)
- **Ramps and stairs:** Traversal structures
- **Obstacles:** Walls, barriers, holes
- **Jump puzzles:** Platforms requiring precise movement
- **Collectibles:** Items to gather (if game needs them)

### World Building (Low Priority - Content Driven)
- **Art style:** Currently graybox/wireframe (intentional for iteration)
- **Lighting:** Basic directional light exists, could enhance
- **Skybox:** Environment backdrop
- **Props:** Visual detail objects (no mechanical meaning = noise)

## Camera & Controls

### Camera Enhancements (Low Priority)
- **Camera collision:** Prevent clipping through walls
- **Smart framing:** Keep character and target both visible
- **Camera shake:** Impact feedback
- **Follow smoothing:** Lag/lead based on velocity
- **Zoom control:** Dynamic FOV or distance

### Input Refinements (Low Priority)
- **Gamepad support:** Already have sokol support, just wire it
- **Input buffering:** Queue commands during animations
- **Sensitivity curves:** Configurable response curves
- **Rebindable keys:** Let player remap controls

## Audio & Feedback

### Audio System (Uncertain - Defer)
- **Footstep sounds:** Distance-phased triggering (matches surveyor wheel)
- **Impact sounds:** Landing, collision, attack
- **Ambient audio:** Environmental loops
- **Music system:** Dynamic music based on state
- **3D audio:** Spatial sound positioning

### Feedback (Medium Priority)
- **Screen effects:** Chromatic aberration on impact, vignette
- **Particle systems:** Dust on landing, trail on dash
- **Screen shake:** Camera impulse on impacts
- **Time effects:** Slow motion, freeze frames

## UI & Menus

### Debug UI (High Priority - Pull Soon)
- **Real-time parameter tuning:** GUI sliders for tilt_smoothing, tilt_magnitude, etc.
  - *Currently:* character_panel exists for locomotion
  - *Need:* Expand for animation parameters
  - *Certainty:* High (~80%) - proven pattern, just add sliders
- **Debug visualization:** Draw acceleration vectors, tilt angles, velocity
- **Performance stats:** Frame time, draw calls
- **State display:** Grounded, velocity magnitude, etc.

### Game UI (Uncertain - Defer)
- **Main menu:** Start, options, quit
- **Pause menu:** Resume, restart, quit
- **HUD elements:** Health, stamina, whatever game needs
- **Settings menu:** Graphics, audio, controls

## Content & Polish

### Visual Polish (Low Priority - Premature)
- **Character mesh:** Replace sphere with visible body
  - *Note:* Currently sphere is intentional (graybox iteration)
  - *When:* After core feel proven through playtesting
  - *Risk:* Art hides mechanical problems
- **Texture/materials:** PBR materials, surface detail
- **Post-processing:** Bloom, color grading, anti-aliasing
- **Animation polish:** Secondary motion, anticipation, follow-through

### Game Loop (Uncertain - Core Unclear)
- **Win/lose conditions:** What is player trying to do?
- **Objectives:** What are the goals?
- **Progression:** How does game evolve?
- **Scoring:** How is player performance measured?
- **Replayability:** What brings player back?

*Note: These are therapeutic planning - written to reduce anxiety, not coordinate work. Actual game design will emerge through iteration and serendipity capture.*

## Frogs Rule! 🐸

### Frog-Specific Ideas (Wild Speculation)
- **Tongue grapple:** Long-range grab mechanic
- **Hop charge:** Hold jump for bigger leap
- **Sticky surfaces:** Walk on walls/ceilings
- **Water advantage:** Move faster in water than on land
- **Fly catching:** Projectile tongue attacks
- **Inflation:** Puff up for defense or floating
- **Spawn eggs:** Lay eggs that hatch into allies?
- **Croak communication:** Audio signals affect environment
- **Metamorphosis:** Tadpole → frog progression system
- **Lily pad platforms:** Environmental interaction

*Certainty: ~0% - Pure creative exploration. Most will be cut. Kept here for inspiration.*

**Notes:**
- Ideas here are deliberately non-interlocking and liquid
- No assumed certainty about implementation
- Pull from backlog only when foundation reaches 90%+ certainty
- Most items will never be implemented (feature, not bug)
