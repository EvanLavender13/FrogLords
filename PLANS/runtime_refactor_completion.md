# Runtime Refactor - Completion Summary

## Objective
Decompose monolithic `runtime.cpp` (422 lines) into focused, single-responsibility modules following project principles.

## Completed Changes

### New Modules Created

#### 1. `rendering/debug_draw.h/cpp` (163 lines)
**Purpose:** Visualize character state for debugging

**Functions:**
- `draw_character_state()` - Bumper/weightlifter spheres, velocity, speed thresholds, orientation
- `draw_physics_springs()` - Spring visualization with compression/stretch coloring
- `draw_locomotion_wheel()` - Surveyor wheel with spokes
- `draw_foot_positions()` - Left/right foot placement

**Design:**
- Pure reactive layer (reads state, doesn't modify)
- All visualization code isolated
- Can be disabled/modified without touching core logic
- Uses `draw_context` struct to pass renderer and unit meshes

#### 2. `character/tuning.h/cpp` (41 lines)
**Purpose:** Translate designer-friendly parameters to physics constants

**Components:**
- `tuning_params` struct - time_to_max_speed, jump_height
- `apply_to()` - Convert to ground_accel, friction, jump_velocity
- `read_from()` - Extract designer params from character
- `sync_locomotion_targets()` - Update locomotion speed thresholds

**Design:**
- Lives in character layer (correct dependency flow)
- Separates interface from implementation
- Reusable for save files, editor tools, networked sync

#### 3. `gui/character_panel.h/cpp` (30 lines)
**Purpose:** ImGui panel for runtime character tuning

**Components:**
- `character_panel_state` - Panel visibility, UI state
- `draw_character_panel()` - Sliders for speed, jump, gravity
- Auto-syncs locomotion targets when parameters change

**Design:**
- GUI is reactive layer above character
- Self-contained (owns its presentation logic)
- Consistent with `gui::` namespace pattern

### Refactored `app/runtime.cpp`
**Before:** 422 lines
**After:** 167 lines (60% reduction)

**Removed:**
- 50 lines of parameter conversion logic → `character/tuning.cpp`
- 30 lines of GUI building → `gui/character_panel.cpp`
- 175 lines of debug visualization → `rendering/debug_draw.cpp`

**Kept:**
- Application lifecycle (init, shutdown, frame pump)
- Input routing (camera orbit, scroll)
- Simulation orchestration
- Scene management
- Static mesh caching

**Changed function signatures:**
- `sync_locomotion_speed_targets()` removed (moved to `character::sync_locomotion_targets()`)
- `begin_gui_frame()` removed (direct call to `gui::begin_frame()`)
- `build_character_panel()` removed (now `gui::draw_character_panel()`)

### Updated Files

#### `app/runtime.h` (41 lines)
- Removed `intuitive_character_params` (→ `character::tuning_params`)
- Added includes for new modules
- Changed member: `intuitive_character_params` → `character::tuning_params`
- Added member: `gui::character_panel_state panel_state`
- Removed member: `bool show_character_panel`
- Removed methods: `sync_locomotion_speed_targets()`, `begin_gui_frame()`, `build_character_panel()`

#### `CMakeLists.txt`
Added source files:
- `src/character/tuning.cpp`
- `src/rendering/debug_draw.cpp`
- `src/gui/character_panel.cpp`

## Dependency Flow (After Refactor)

```
foundation/               # Collision, easing, springs
    ↓
character/
    ├── character_controller
    ├── locomotion
    ├── orientation
    └── tuning            # NEW: Parameter translation
    ↓
camera/
    └── camera
    ↓
rendering/
    ├── renderer
    ├── scene
    ├── wireframe
    └── debug_draw        # NEW: Debug visualization
    ↓
gui/
    ├── gui (core)
    └── character_panel   # NEW: Character tuning UI
    ↓
app/
    └── runtime           # Orchestration only
```

**Clean bottom-up flow. No sideways dependencies.**

## Principle Adherence

### ✓ Clarity over cleverness
- Each module has obvious, single purpose
- Debug visualization clearly separated from rendering
- Parameter conversion isolated from character physics

### ✓ Simplicity over sophistication
- No premature abstraction
- Straightforward function boundaries
- Minimal coupling between modules

### ✓ Dependency Management
- Fixed upward dependency violations
- Character layer doesn't depend on app layer
- Reactive layers (GUI, debug draw) correctly sit above core logic

### ✓ Iteration speed
- Can modify debug visualization without recompiling character code
- GUI changes don't touch simulation
- Parameter tuning lives with character (find what you need where you expect it)

## Benefits Realized

1. **Testability** - Debug draw can be unit tested with mock state
2. **Reusability** - Tuning params useful for save files, network sync, editor
3. **Clarity** - Each file has single, obvious responsibility
4. **Maintainability** - Changes localized (add debug feature → edit debug_draw.cpp only)
5. **Build speed** - Smaller compilation units, less cascading rebuilds
6. **Cognitive load** - 167 line orchestrator vs 422 line monolith

## Testing

✓ Build successful (Ninja)
✓ Application runs
✓ Character movement functional
✓ Debug visualization renders correctly
✓ GUI panel displays and updates parameters
✓ Locomotion targets sync on parameter changes
