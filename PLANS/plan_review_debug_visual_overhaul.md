# Principle Review: debug_visual_overhaul

### 1. Summary

Plans are **strongly aligned** with core principles. Feature represents exemplary adherence to graybox-first workflow, pure reactive layering, and reusability patterns. No direct violations found. Implementation plan correctly identifies state ownership (game_world), breaks down into atomic steps, and maintains clean separation between debug visualization and gameplay. Minimal risks identified; main uncertainty appropriately scoped to visual parameter tuning (fade rates, colors, graph scales). Ready to proceed.

### 2. Violations & Contradictions

**None identified.**

### 3. Misalignments & Risks

- **Misalignment:** State ownership decision documented but slightly ambiguous in feature plan
  - **Source:** `PLANS/feature_debug_visual_overhaul.md` line 37
  - **Principle:** "Bottom-up dependencies" / "Single source of truth"
  - **Details:** Feature plan states "Character state holder (position sampling state for trail buffer)" without specifying exact location. Implementation plan correctly resolves this to `game_world` (lines 48-54), which is correct architectural choice since velocity trail is world-space data independent of controller internals.
  - **Suggestion:** None required - implementation plan resolves ambiguity correctly. Minor documentation improvement would be adding brief rationale for game_world choice in feature plan (e.g., "trail is world-space visualization, independent of controller internals").

- **Misalignment:** Speed circle overshoot artifact already documented in backlog
  - **Source:** `PLANS/feature_debug_visual_overhaul.md` vs `PLANS/DESIGN_BACKLOG.md` (lines 13-27)
  - **Principle:** "Iteration over planning" / Knowledge creation
  - **Details:** Both documents describe the same speed circle overshoot issue. Feature plan correctly identifies fix (speed gradient ring), but backlog entry contains additional context from 2025-10-09 playtest (SHIFT key walk lock revealed red circle larger than green despite 2.0 m/s cap). Implementation plan does not reference this specific diagnostic.
  - **Suggestion:** During implementation, verify fix addresses root cause identified in backlog (pre-cap vs post-friction rendering). Consider consolidating diagnostic notes from backlog into implementation comments for future reference.

- **Risk:** Plot function static map storage may need cleanup
  - **Source:** `PLANS/iteration_debug_visual_overhaul.md` line 73
  - **Principle:** "Implementation cost" / "Maintenance burden"
  - **Details:** Plan acknowledges plot function uses static map keyed by label string, noting "might need cleanup if labels change frequently (low risk for debug use)". Risk is appropriately identified and scoped as low.
  - **Suggestion:** Add brief comment in implementation noting static storage assumption (debug-only, stable label set expected). If future use requires dynamic label creation/destruction, refactor to explicit registration/cleanup API.

- **Risk:** Velocity trail 1-second sampling may miss fast direction changes
  - **Source:** `PLANS/iteration_debug_visual_overhaul.md` line 72
  - **Principle:** "Iteration over planning" / "Graybox first"
  - **Details:** Plan acknowledges 1-second sampling interval might miss fast turns, correctly defers tuning until graybox testing ("can adjust sampling rate if needed").
  - **Suggestion:** None required - risk appropriately identified, testing protocol covers this (line 43: "Run in circles/figure-8sâ€”does trail clearly show turning radius?"). Graybox approach correct.

### 4. Actionable Items

- [ ] **Optional:** Add brief state ownership rationale to feature plan (why game_world vs controller for trail buffer)
- [ ] During implementation, cross-reference backlog diagnostic (SHIFT key walk lock overshoot) to verify speed gradient ring fix addresses root cause
- [ ] Add implementation comment noting static map storage assumption for plot function (debug-only, stable labels)
- [ ] During testing, verify 1-second trail sampling captures turning behavior adequately (adjust if needed)
- [ ] After completion, update DESIGN_BACKLOG.md to mark "Debug Visual Overhaul" entry as complete or remove if fully addressed

**Review Date:** 2025-10-10
**Branch:** iteration/debug_visual_overhaul
**Reviewer Notes:** Exemplary planning adherence. Feature demonstrates mature understanding of graybox workflow, reactive layering, and reusability patterns. No blocking issues. Proceed with confidence.
