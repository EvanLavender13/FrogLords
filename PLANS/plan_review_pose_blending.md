# Principle Review: Pose Blending

**Review Date:** 2025-10-11

**Branch:** `iteration/pose_blending`

**Reviewer Assessment:** **STRONGLY ALIGNED** with core principles. This is an exemplary feature plan that demonstrates mature understanding of the project's methodology. The scope is appropriately minimal, the architecture is sound, and the implementation path is clear. This feature is ready for implementation with high confidence.

---

## 1. Summary

The pose blending plans are **exceptionally well-aligned** with core principles from `AGENTS.md`. This feature represents the natural evolution of the skeletal animation stack, building directly on proven foundations (Static Keyframe Preview, Primary Skeletal Animation, Secondary Motion) with minimal architectural risk.

**Key Strengths:**
- **Perfect "Stupid Simple Core" scoping:** Extends existing distance-phased pattern with single interpolation primitive (slerp)
- **GDC-validated approach:** Linear slerp for locomotion blending is industry-proven (Overgrowth methodology)
- **Appropriate certainty:** 85% score is realistic given 3 prior keyframe validation iterations
- **Clean architecture:** No ownership conflicts, isolated modification to single function
- **Tight feedback loop:** Instant visual feedback, ~40-60 lines of code, 1-2 expected iterations
- **No cascading dependencies:** Secondary motion system already decoupled and ready

**Minor Considerations:**
- Last segment wrap logic (0.75-1.0 → STEP_LEFT) is critical but well-documented
- Spring parameters may need retuning after blending (correctly mitigated: "test unchanged first")
- Implementation adds ~30 net lines to a proven system (low maintenance burden)

**Verdict:** This is a **foundational upgrade** that removes technical debt (compensating for pops) while unlocking future content (2D blend spaces, run cycles). The plan demonstrates exceptional adherence to "graybox before polish," "iteration over planning," and "elegance through emergence." **Proceed with confidence.**

---

## 2. Violations & Contradictions

**None identified.** The plans adhere strictly to all relevant principles from `AGENTS.md`.

This is notable because the review protocol specifically looks for common failure modes (premature polish, missing prerequisites, scope creep, reactive control, system duplication). This plan avoids all of them:

- ✅ **Not premature polish:** Blending improves graybox animation quality without adding art assets
- ✅ **Prerequisites validated:** Quaternion architecture proven through 3 iterations
- ✅ **Scope disciplined:** 40-60 lines, single function modification, no feature creep
- ✅ **Respects core logic:** Reactive layers (springs) remain decoupled from blending logic
- ✅ **No duplication:** Extends existing `update_skeletal_animation()`, doesn't create parallel system

---

## 3. Misalignments & Risks

While no direct violations exist, the following items warrant attention during implementation:

### 3.1 Critical Implementation Detail: Phase Wrap Logic

- **Source:** [PLANS/feature_pose_blending.md:10](feature_pose_blending.md#L10), [PLANS/iteration_pose_blending.md:36](iteration_pose_blending.md#L36), [PLANS/implementation_pose_blending.md:89](implementation_pose_blending.md#L89)
- **Principle:** "Clarity over cleverness" / "Iteration over planning"
- **Details:** The last blend segment (phase 0.75-1.0) must target `STEP_LEFT` (not `NEUTRAL`) for seamless loop wrap. This is **architecturally correct** but easy to implement incorrectly.

  **Current threshold logic** ([animation.cpp:127-135](../src/character/animation.cpp#L127-L135)):
  ```cpp
  if (phase < 0.25f) {
      current_automatic_pose = pose_type::STEP_LEFT;
  } else if (phase < 0.5f) {
      current_automatic_pose = pose_type::NEUTRAL;
  } else if (phase < 0.75f) {
      current_automatic_pose = pose_type::STEP_RIGHT;
  } else {
      current_automatic_pose = pose_type::NEUTRAL;  // ← This changes!
  }
  ```

  **Required blending logic:**
  ```
  Segment 1 (0.00-0.25): STEP_LEFT → NEUTRAL
  Segment 2 (0.25-0.50): NEUTRAL → STEP_RIGHT
  Segment 3 (0.50-0.75): STEP_RIGHT → NEUTRAL
  Segment 4 (0.75-1.00): NEUTRAL → STEP_LEFT  ← Wraps to phase 0.0 seamlessly
  ```

- **Risk:** If the last segment incorrectly targets `NEUTRAL → NEUTRAL` (copying old threshold pattern), phase wrap at 0.99 → 0.01 will produce a visible snap from NEUTRAL to STEP_LEFT.
- **Mitigation:** Implementation plan explicitly calls this out ([implementation_pose_blending.md:89](implementation_pose_blending.md#L89)). The pseudocode is correct. **During first playtest, watch the phase wrap explicitly** (walk in circles, observe phase value near 1.0 → 0.0 in animation panel).
- **Suggestion:** Add a comment in the code explaining why segment 4 targets STEP_LEFT, not NEUTRAL. This prevents future confusion during refactoring.

**Severity:** Medium-High risk, but **well-mitigated** by explicit documentation. This is the most important test case.

---

### 3.2 Spring Parameter Retuning May Be Required

- **Source:** [PLANS/iteration_pose_blending.md:148-149](iteration_pose_blending.md#L148-L149)
- **Principle:** "Testing Protocol (Get Real Signals)" / "Paradox of quality"
- **Details:** Current secondary motion springs are tuned to respond to **discrete pose pops** (sudden large rotation deltas). After blending, parent joints will rotate **smoothly and continuously**, producing smaller but constant velocity inputs to springs.

  **Current spring behavior** (discrete switching):
  ```
  Phase 0.0-0.24: STEP_LEFT held → springs settle
  Phase 0.25:     *SNAP* to NEUTRAL → large delta → wobble burst
  Phase 0.25-0.49: NEUTRAL held → springs settle again
  ```

  **Future spring behavior** (with blending):
  ```
  Phase 0.0-0.5: Continuously interpolating → constant small deltas → smooth lag
  ```

- **Hypothesis:** Springs will shift from "wobble compensation" to "natural follow-through" (their intended purpose). See [NOTES/pose_blending_explained.md:544-586](../NOTES/pose_blending_explained.md#L544-L586) for detailed analysis.
- **Risk:** If springs become too subtle or feel "dead," parameters may need adjustment:
  - Increase `response_scale` (0.02 → 0.03-0.05) to amplify lag
  - Decrease `stiffness` (15.0 → 10.0-12.0) for softer springs
  - Decrease `damping_ratio` (1.0 → 0.7-0.8) for underdamped wobble
- **Mitigation:** Plans correctly prioritize "test unchanged first." Animation panel already exposes all spring parameters for real-time tuning ([animation.h:34-36](../src/character/animation.h#L34-L36)).
- **Suggestion:** During first playtest, compare spring behavior before/after blending using git stash:
  1. Implement blending, test feel
  2. `git stash` (revert to discrete switching)
  3. Compare spring wobble characteristics side-by-side
  4. Restore blending, adjust parameters if needed

**Severity:** Low-Medium risk. Spring retuning is a solved problem (proven tuning UI workflow). This is expected iteration, not a blocker.

---

### 3.3 Potential Complexity: Segment Determination Logic

- **Source:** [PLANS/implementation_pose_blending.md:85-123](implementation_pose_blending.md#L85-L123)
- **Principle:** "Simplicity over sophistication" / "Clarity over cleverness"
- **Details:** The implementation plan proposes an if-else chain to determine source/target poses and blend factor:
  ```cpp
  if (phase < 0.25) {
      source = STEP_LEFT, target = NEUTRAL
      segment_start = 0.0, segment_end = 0.25
  } else if (phase < 0.5) {
      source = NEUTRAL, target = STEP_RIGHT
      segment_start = 0.25, segment_end = 0.5
  } // ... etc
  t = (phase - segment_start) / (segment_end - segment_start)
  ```

  This is **straightforward and correct**, but adds ~25 lines to replace 12 lines of threshold logic (net +13 lines of branching).

- **Observation:** This is the right approach for a 4-segment walk cycle. If future work adds more poses (e.g., 8-frame walk cycle, transition to crouching), the if-else chain will grow linearly.
- **Not a violation:** AGENTS.md warns against "over-engineering for imagined futures" and advises "wait for the third use before abstracting." Four segments is not excessive. A data-driven segment array would be premature.
- **Suggestion:** If blending logic is reused for run cycles (second use case), keep the if-else pattern. Only extract a `blend_segment()` utility if a **third distinct use case** emerges (e.g., swim cycle, climb cycle). Current plan is appropriately simple.

**Severity:** Not a risk. This observation validates the plan's adherence to "simplicity over sophistication."

---

### 3.4 Data Structure Validation: Slerp Correctness Assumption

- **Source:** [PLANS/iteration_pose_blending.md:151](iteration_pose_blending.md#L151)
- **Principle:** "Dependencies & Uncertainty" / "Data Structure Validation"
- **Details:** The plan assumes GLM's `glm::slerp(quat, quat, float)` handles shortest-path interpolation correctly. This is marked as "Mitigation: Standard library function; validated in thousands of projects."
- **Cross-check with AGENTS.md:45:** "When introducing novel data representations (quaternions, new state formats), validate the representation in isolation before building complex features on it."
- **Assessment:** **This is not a novel data representation.** Quaternions were validated in Static Keyframe Preview iteration. GLM slerp is industry-standard. The principle applies to "new state formats," not standard library functions.
- **Additional validation:** Quaternion architecture has been battle-tested through:
  1. Static Keyframe Preview (2025-10-08): Quaternion keyframes proven
  2. Primary Skeletal Animation (2025-10-09): Distance-phased application validated
  3. Secondary Motion (2025-10-09): Quaternion delta detection working

  Three iterations confirm the data structure is sufficient.

**Severity:** Not a risk. This is a **correctly applied standard library function** on a **proven data structure**.

---

### 3.5 Minor Observation: No New Parameters Exposed

- **Source:** [PLANS/iteration_pose_blending.md:77-80](iteration_pose_blending.md#L77-L80)
- **Principle:** "Graybox First" / "Parameters over assets"
- **Details:** The plan states "No new parameters needed for core blending." Existing parameters (`cycle_length`, spring parameters) are already tunable via GUI.
- **Observation:** This is **correct for the graybox scope**. However, future work (custom easing curves, non-linear phase mapping) may want to expose blend shaping parameters.
- **Not a problem:** Plans correctly defer this to backlog ([iteration_pose_blending.md:164](iteration_pose_blending.md#L164)). Custom phase easing is a separate feature (60% certainty, depends on walk↔run first).
- **Suggestion:** If blended motion feels "too linear" during testing, resist the urge to add easing parameters immediately. Test with unchanged springs first. Only add blend shaping if linear interpolation + springs don't produce natural feel.

**Severity:** Not a risk. This observation confirms appropriate scope discipline.

---

## 4. Architecture Verification

### 4.1 System Ownership ✅

**Verified against current codebase:**

- `animation_state`: Owned by `controller.animation` ([controller.h:57](../src/character/controller.h#L57)) ✅
- `skeleton`: Owned by `game_world.t_pose_skeleton` ([game_world.h:29](../src/app/game_world.h#L29)), passed by reference ✅
- `keyframe` functions: Stateless utilities ([keyframe.cpp:84-143](../src/character/keyframe.cpp#L84-L143)) ✅
- Call site: [game_world.cpp:79-81](../src/app/game_world.cpp#L79-L81) correctly invokes `update_skeletal_animation()` ✅

**Conclusion:** No ownership conflicts. Modification confined to `animation_state::update_skeletal_animation()` which already operates on `skeleton&`. Implementation plan correctly identifies all integration points.

---

### 4.2 No System Migration Required ✅

**Retrospective check:** Previous iterations (Static Keyframe Preview, Primary Skeletal Animation) required careful system migrations:
- Static Preview: Added GUI panel, introduced keyframe architecture
- Primary Animation: Migrated distance-phased triggering from body bounce to skeletal system
- Secondary Motion: Added spring-damper system on top of primary animation

**This iteration:** Extends existing `update_skeletal_animation()` function. No new systems introduced. No migration steps needed.

**Conclusion:** Clean architectural upgrade. This is the "polish existing system" stage, not "add new system" stage.

---

### 4.3 Dependency Stack Placement ✅

**Current position** ([DEPENDENCY_STACK.md:11-22](DEPENDENCY_STACK.md#L11-L22)):
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         DESIGN BACKLOG              │  ← Everything else (liquid)
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Debug Visual Overhaul (100%) ✅    │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Secondary Motion (100%) ✅         │  ← Depends on this
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Primary Skeletal Animation (100%) ✅│  ← Pose blending extends this
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Static Keyframe Preview (100%) ✅  │  ← Quaternions validated here
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Verification:**
- **Direct prerequisites:** Primary Skeletal Animation (distance-phased), Static Keyframe Preview (quaternions), GLM slerp (standard library) → All proven ✅
- **Dependent systems:** Secondary Motion (springs) → Already decoupled, operates on blended output unchanged ✅
- **Enables:** 2D blend space (walk↔run), speed-based animation scaling, custom easing curves → Correctly deferred to backlog ✅

**Conclusion:** Perfect placement. Building on 100% certain foundation, unlocking appropriately uncertain future work.

---

### 4.4 Mechanic Interactions ✅

**Verified against iteration plan** ([iteration_pose_blending.md:126-131](iteration_pose_blending.md#L126-L131)):

- **Secondary motion springs:** Correctly identified as "reactive to blended output" ([NOTES/pose_blending_explained.md:507-617](../NOTES/pose_blending_explained.md#L507-L617)) ✅
- **Manual override mode:** Early return path unchanged ([animation.cpp:114-120](../src/character/animation.cpp#L114-L120)) ✅
- **Locomotion distance tracking:** Phase calculation reused ([animation.cpp:122-123](../src/character/animation.cpp#L122-L123)) ✅
- **Acceleration tilt / landing spring:** Independent systems ([animation.cpp:29-76](../src/character/animation.cpp#L29-L76)) ✅

**Conclusion:** No mechanical conflicts. All integration points identified and verified.

---

## 5. Scope & Certainty Analysis

### 5.1 "Stupid Simple Core" Validation ✅

**AGENTS.md principle:** "Simplicity over sophistication" / "Graybox scope"

**Proposed scope:**
- Extract `get_keyframe_data()` function (~15 lines)
- Replace threshold logic with segment-based blending (~35 lines)
- Remove discrete selection (-12 lines)
- Net: ~40-60 lines, single function modification

**Cross-check against previous iterations:**
- Static Keyframe Preview: Added 4 keyframe poses + GUI panel (~150 lines)
- Primary Skeletal Animation: Added distance-phased triggering (~80 lines)
- Secondary Motion: Added spring-damper system (~120 lines)

**Assessment:** This iteration is **smaller and simpler** than previous validated iterations. Scope is appropriately minimal. No unnecessary features (2D blend space, easing curves, IK) included.

**Conclusion:** Scope perfectly matches "stupid simple core" principle. This is an **upgrade**, not a **new system**.

---

### 5.2 Certainty Score: 85% ✅

**AGENTS.md guidance:** "Certainty tags with realistic scores"

**Factors supporting 85% certainty:**
1. ✅ Quaternion architecture validated (Static Keyframe Preview)
2. ✅ Distance-phased pattern proven (Primary Skeletal Animation)
3. ✅ Secondary motion decoupling validated (springs already working)
4. ✅ GLM slerp is industry-standard (zero novelty)
5. ✅ GDC-validated approach (Overgrowth methodology documented)
6. ✅ Tight feedback loop (instant visual verification)

**15% uncertainty allocated to:**
- Last segment wrap logic (0.75-1.0 → STEP_LEFT) correctness
- Spring parameter retuning after blending
- Unforeseen edge cases in slerp application

**Cross-check with previous iterations:**
- Static Keyframe Preview: Started at 60% (novel quaternion validation), finished at 100%
- Primary Skeletal Animation: Started at 75% (threshold tuning uncertain), finished at 100%
- Secondary Motion: Started at 70% (spring parameter tuning uncertain), finished at 100%

**Assessment:** 85% is **appropriately confident** given proven foundation. This is higher certainty than previous iterations at equivalent stage, which is correct—each iteration validates more of the stack.

**Conclusion:** Certainty score is realistic and well-justified.

---

### 5.3 Iteration Cadence ✅

**Proposed cadence** ([iteration_pose_blending.md:112-116](iteration_pose_blending.md#L112-L116)):
- Complexity: 1-2 points (single-function modification)
- Test loop: < 5 minutes (instant visual feedback)
- Iteration count: 1-2 expected (slerp logic + optional spring retuning)

**Comparison to AGENTS.md guidance:**
- "Original/uncertain → plan 1-3 complexity points ahead" ✅
- "Lower test cost → shorter horizon" ✅
- "Big leaps are allowed; do them intentionally" → Not applicable (this is incremental) ✅

**Comparison to previous iterations:**
- Static Keyframe Preview: 1 iteration (quaternion validation)
- Primary Skeletal Animation: 2 iterations (threshold tuning, cycle length adjustment)
- Secondary Motion: 2 iterations (spring parameters, axis alignment)

**Assessment:** Expected iteration count matches historical pattern. Test loop is faster than previous iterations (no new GUI panels needed).

**Conclusion:** Iteration cadence is appropriately aggressive given high certainty.

---

## 6. Testing Protocol Review

### 6.1 Success Metrics Are Concrete ✅

**Proposed metrics** ([iteration_pose_blending.md:105-110](iteration_pose_blending.md#L105-L110)):
1. Zero visible pops during continuous locomotion
2. Phase wrap at 1.0 → 0.0 is seamless
3. Spring behavior feels natural (not fighting the blend)
4. Frame time unchanged (< 1% difference)
5. Feature enables confident planning of run cycle content

**Assessment:** All metrics are **directly observable** through existing debug UI:
- Animation panel shows phase value in real-time ✅
- Skeleton debug visualization shows limb motion ✅
- Frame time display exists in character panel ✅
- Spring parameters adjustable in real-time ✅

**Comparison to AGENTS.md:** "Use metrics when helpful to see small effects and rare edge cases" → Performance metric (< 1% frame time) is appropriately quantitative. Visual metrics rely on "get real signals" through observation.

**Conclusion:** Testing protocol is thorough and actionable.

---

### 6.2 Self-Test Protocol Is Sufficient ✅

**AGENTS.md guidance:** "Self-test early; then over-the-shoulder tests"

**Proposed protocol** ([iteration_pose_blending.md:82-103](iteration_pose_blending.md#L82-L103)):
1. Smoothness check (walk in circles, watch phase transitions)
2. Wrap continuity (observe 1.0 → 0.0 transition)
3. Spring behavior (compare before/after, test parameters unchanged)
4. Performance (monitor frame time)

**Assessment:** Self-test is appropriate for this feature because:
- Visual quality improvement (animator judgment sufficient)
- No gameplay impact (animation layer only)
- Real-time parameter tuning available (immediate feedback)
- No user understanding complexity (transparent improvement)

**Cross-check:** Secondary Motion iteration used identical self-test approach and succeeded. Primary Skeletal Animation also self-tested successfully.

**Conclusion:** Self-test is sufficient. Over-the-shoulder testing not needed until gameplay-impacting features emerge.

---

### 6.3 Edge Case Coverage ✅

**Identified edge cases** ([implementation_pose_blending.md:232-241](implementation_pose_blending.md#L232-L241)):
- Manual override mode (early return path)
- Secondary motion toggle (springs on/off)
- Phase wrap at 1.0 boundary (NEUTRAL → STEP_LEFT)

**Additional edge cases to verify during implementation:**
- Phase exactly at segment boundaries (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0) → blend factor `t = 0.0` or `t = 1.0`
- Very low velocity (phase changes slowly) → blending still smooth
- Very high velocity (phase changes quickly) → no visual artifacts

**Suggestion:** Add explicit test for boundary values:
- Walk until phase = 0.24999, then cross to 0.25001 → verify no discontinuity
- Stop exactly at phase = 0.25 → verify frozen mid-blend looks acceptable

**Conclusion:** Edge case coverage is good. Minor additions recommended for boundary testing.

---

## 7. Future Work & Emergence Validation

### 7.1 Unlocked Features Are Appropriately Deferred ✅

**Stated unlocks** ([feature_pose_blending.md:18](feature_pose_blending.md#L18)):
- 2D blend space (walk↔run speed blending)
- Speed-based animation scaling
- Custom easing curves

**Backlog placement** ([iteration_pose_blending.md:163-166](iteration_pose_blending.md#L163-166)):
- 2D Blend Space: 70% certainty (natural next step)
- Custom Phase Easing: 60% certainty (depends on walk↔run first)
- Speed-Based Stride Scaling: 75% certainty (surveyor-wheel pattern proven)

**AGENTS.md principle:** "Pull from backlog only when current layer is 90%+ certain"

**Assessment:** All future work correctly lives in DESIGN_BACKLOG, not in this implementation plan. Certainty scores for future work are lower than current feature (85%), which is correct—blending must validate first.

**Conclusion:** Emergence path is well-understood without overplanning. This validates the "elegance through emergence" principle.

---

### 7.2 No Content Restrictions Introduced ✅

**AGENTS.md warning:** "Don't add mechanics that force level/art constraints"

**Analysis:** Pose blending is a **pure upgrade** to existing system. It:
- Doesn't add new gameplay constraints (no new jump heights, collision rules)
- Doesn't restrict future content (enables richer animation, doesn't prescribe it)
- Doesn't force art direction (graybox wireframe skeleton unchanged)
- Doesn't impose level design requirements (animation is self-contained)

**Cross-check:** Compare to "bad example" from AGENTS.md: "20-ft jump that breaks worlds." Pose blending has no such implications—it's an internal animation quality improvement.

**Conclusion:** No content restrictions introduced. This is a foundational upgrade, not a constraint.

---

## 8. Code Review: Implementation Plan Quality

### 8.1 Checklist Structure ✅

**Implementation plan format** ([implementation_pose_blending.md:27-244](implementation_pose_blending.md#L27-L244)):
- Foundation architecture review (lines 11-24)
- Step-by-step checklist with checkboxes
- Pseudocode for each step
- Quality gates (build, format, smoke test)
- Testing protocol (post-implementation)
- Implementation notes (GLM slerp usage, joint indices)

**Assessment:** This is **exemplary documentation**. The checklist format enables:
- Incremental progress tracking (check off items as implemented)
- Clear success criteria per step
- Reference patterns from existing code (copy-paste targets identified)
- Explicit file/line number citations for context

**Comparison to previous iterations:** Primary Skeletal Animation used similar checklist format and succeeded on first attempt. Pattern proven.

**Conclusion:** Implementation plan is thorough and actionable.

---

### 8.2 Pattern Reuse Identified ✅

**Explicitly called out patterns** ([implementation_pose_blending.md:260-262](implementation_pose_blending.md#L260-L262)):
- Root transform store/restore: [keyframe.cpp:146-153](../src/character/keyframe.cpp#L146-L153)
- Apply quaternion to joint: [keyframe.cpp:181-187](../src/character/keyframe.cpp#L181-L187)
- T-pose position extraction: [keyframe.cpp:183](../src/character/keyframe.cpp#L183)

**Verification:** All referenced code exists and is correct:
- Root handling in `apply_pose()` ([keyframe.cpp:67-74](../src/character/keyframe.cpp#L67-L74)) ✅
- `apply_joint` lambda pattern ([keyframe.cpp:102-108](../src/character/keyframe.cpp#L102-L108)) ✅
- Joint indices namespace ([keyframe.cpp:32-50](../src/character/keyframe.cpp#L32-L50)) ✅

**AGENTS.md principle:** "Abstract repeated patterns into systems"

**Assessment:** Implementation correctly reuses existing patterns rather than inventing new ones. The `apply_joint` lambda will be extracted inline (following existing pattern from `apply_pose()`), which is appropriate—it's used 8 times within one function, not across multiple files.

**Conclusion:** Pattern reuse demonstrates codebase familiarity and design consistency.

---

### 8.3 Segment Design Rationale ✅

**Documented reasoning** ([implementation_pose_blending.md:264-267](implementation_pose_blending.md#L264-L267)):
- Last segment targets STEP_LEFT for seamless wrap
- Four equal segments create symmetric gait
- Neutral poses are "passing through" frames

**Assessment:** This demonstrates **design intent**, not just implementation steps. Future maintainers will understand *why* the logic is structured this way.

**AGENTS.md principle:** "Communicate intent"

**Conclusion:** Rationale documentation is excellent. This prevents "why is this here?" confusion during future refactoring.

---

## 9. GDC Methodology Alignment

The [NOTES/pose_blending_explained.md](../NOTES/pose_blending_explained.md) document extensively cross-references the Overgrowth GDC talks. Let me verify alignment with AGENTS.md principles:

### 9.1 "Three Layers of Interpolation" Correctly Applied ✅

**GDC framework** ([pose_blending_explained.md:356-502](../NOTES/pose_blending_explained.md#L356-L502)):
1. **Pose blending (slerp):** Smooth transitions between keyframes → This feature
2. **State transitions (springs):** Natural easing for events → Already implemented (secondary motion)
3. **Curve-based interpolation (cubic):** Velocity continuity for special moves → Deferred to backlog

**Assessment:** The plan correctly identifies linear slerp as appropriate for locomotion ([pose_blending_explained.md:472-488](../NOTES/pose_blending_explained.md#L472-L488)). Cubic interpolation is explicitly deferred to "flips/rolls" future work. This matches GDC methodology exactly.

**AGENTS.md principle:** "Use the full deck: research, written analysis" → The NOTES document demonstrates thorough research into industry-validated approaches.

**Conclusion:** GDC methodology correctly applied. Not blindly copying—understanding which techniques apply to which problems.

---

### 9.2 Secondary Motion Integration Understanding ✅

**Critical insight** ([pose_blending_explained.md:507-617](../NOTES/pose_blending_explained.md#L507-L617)): Secondary motion springs operate **after** pose blending, not during. They react to blended output.

**Current behavior prediction** ([pose_blending_explained.md:544-586](../NOTES/pose_blending_explained.md#L544-L586)):
- Discrete switching: Springs compensate for pops (wobble bursts)
- Blended motion: Springs add follow-through (continuous lag)

**Assessment:** This demonstrates **deep understanding** of the animation pipeline. The plan anticipates behavior changes without requiring implementation first.

**AGENTS.md principle:** "Knowledge creation > implementation" → This research phase creates confidence before writing code.

**Conclusion:** Spring interaction analysis is thorough and insightful.

---

## 10. Actionable Items

Based on this review, proceed with implementation as planned. The following items are **recommendations**, not blockers:

### Implementation Phase

- [ ] **Proceed with implementation as written** (no plan changes required)
- [ ] During step 2.2 (segment-based blending), **add code comment** explaining why segment 4 targets STEP_LEFT:
  ```cpp
  // Segment 4: 0.75-1.0 blends NEUTRAL → STEP_LEFT (not NEUTRAL → NEUTRAL)
  // This ensures phase wrap at 1.0 → 0.0 is seamless (STEP_LEFT at both boundaries)
  ```
- [ ] Include GLM header verification step ([implementation_pose_blending.md:183-184](implementation_pose_blending.md#L183-L184)): Confirm `glm/gtx/quaternion.hpp` is included for `glm::slerp`

### Testing Phase

- [ ] **First playtest priority: Phase wrap continuity**
  - Walk in continuous circles, watch animation panel phase value near 1.0 → 0.0
  - Success: No visible snap when crossing boundary
  - If snap occurs: Check segment 4 target pose (should be STEP_LEFT, not NEUTRAL)

- [ ] **Test boundary values explicitly:**
  - Walk until phase ≈ 0.25, observe transition smoothness
  - Stop exactly at phase = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 → verify frozen mid-blend looks acceptable
  - If boundary freeze looks broken: This is expected behavior (document as known limitation)

- [ ] **Spring parameter comparison (optional, if feel seems wrong):**
  - Record current spring feel with blending active
  - `git stash` to revert to discrete switching
  - Compare wobble characteristics side-by-side
  - Restore blending, adjust parameters if needed

### Post-Implementation

- [ ] **Update DEPENDENCY_STACK.md** after graybox validation:
  - Move "Pose Blending" from backlog to completed foundation (100%)
  - Update certainty analysis based on tuning difficulty
  - If successful, expect certainty scores for 2D blend space to increase (70% → 85%)

- [ ] **Update DESIGN_BACKLOG.md** if new insights emerge:
  - If spring retuning was easy: Note this as validated pattern
  - If boundary freezing felt awkward: Add "velocity-threshold snap to neutral" backlog item
  - If slerp performance was noticeable: Document (unlikely, but measure)

### Before Next Feature

- [ ] **Create plan review for next backlog pull** (following this proven pattern)
- [ ] If 2D blend space is next: Reference this review as prerequisite validation

## 11. Retrospective Notes for Future Reviews

This review identified **zero violations** and **minor, well-mitigated risks**. This is notable. Key success factors:

1. **Incremental foundation building:** Three prior iterations validated architecture before this upgrade
2. **GDC research:** Industry-validated approach reduces novelty risk
3. **Explicit uncertainty allocation:** 85% certainty acknowledges wrap logic and spring tuning unknowns
4. **Tight feedback loop:** Instant visual verification enables rapid iteration
5. **Scope discipline:** No premature 2D blending, no easing curves, no IK layering

**Pattern for future features:** When a plan receives "zero violations" assessment, it typically indicates:
- Prerequisites are truly proven (not assumed)
- Scope is appropriately minimal (no gold-plating)
- Test loop is well-understood (designer can self-validate)
- Uncertainty is realistic (not overconfident)

**Counterpoint:** If a review finds **no risks whatsoever**, consider whether the feature is too conservative. This plan has appropriate 15% uncertainty—not zero, not 50%. This indicates healthy ambition balanced with realism.

## 12. Final Recommendation

**Status:** ✅ **APPROVED FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

**Confidence Level:** Very High (85% certainty score is well-justified)

**Expected Outcome:** 1-2 iteration loops, graybox validation successful, foundation ready for 2D blend space

**Blocking Issues:** None

**Monitoring Points During Implementation:**
1. Phase wrap at 1.0 → 0.0 (highest risk)
2. Spring parameter feel (moderate risk, easy to fix)
3. Boundary value behavior (low risk, document if weird)

**This is an exemplary feature plan.** It demonstrates mature understanding of the project's principles and represents the natural evolution of a proven system. The documentation is thorough, the scope is disciplined, and the risks are well-mitigated. Proceed with high confidence.

**Next Steps:**
1. Execute implementation checklist ([implementation_pose_blending.md](implementation_pose_blending.md))
2. Perform self-test protocol as specified
3. Update dependency stack after validation
4. Plan 2D blend space as next feature (70% → 85% certainty after this validates)
