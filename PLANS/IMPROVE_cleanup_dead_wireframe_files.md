# Cleanup Dead Wireframe Files

**Severity/Priority:** High

**Current Issue:** The files `src/rendering/wireframe.cpp` and `src/rendering/wireframe.h` are empty and only contain comments indicating their content has been moved. They are dead code.

**Files Affected:**
- `src/rendering/wireframe.cpp`
- `src/rendering/wireframe.h`

**Proposed Fix:** Delete both files from the project.

**Rationale:** Removes dead code, simplifying the codebase and preventing confusion. This aligns with the principle of "simplicity over sophistication."

**Workflow Path:** Path A (Trivial)

**Estimated Complexity:** 1 point

**Risk Level:** Low - The files are unused.

**Tags:** #cleanup, #rendering

## EXECUTION (Trivial Path)

**Executed:**

### Changes Made

**File:** `src/rendering/wireframe.cpp`
- Deleted file

**File:** `src/rendering/wireframe.h`
- Deleted file

**File:** `src/app/game_world.cpp`
- Line 3: Removed #include for `rendering/wireframe.h`

### Verification

- [x] Build succeeds
- [ ] clang-format passed
- [ ] clang-tidy clean
- [ ] No new warnings

### Notes
- The user confirmed the build passed after the include was removed.
- clang-format and clang-tidy were not run as the changes were deletions.

## FINALIZATION

**Finalized:**

### Changes Summary

**Files Modified:**
- `src/rendering/wireframe.cpp` - Deleted
- `src/rendering/wireframe.h` - Deleted
- `src/app/game_world.cpp` - Removed include

**Impact:** Reduced code clutter and removed obsolete files, simplifying the project structure.

### New Items Discovered

**Added to Backlog:** None

### Learnings

**What Worked Well:**
- The trivial workflow is efficient for simple changes.

**What Was Harder Than Expected:**
- Forgetting to check for file inclusions before deleting caused an easily avoidable build error.

**Insights for Future Work:**
- Always search for usages of a file before deleting it.

**Time Estimate Accuracy:**
- Estimated: 1 point
- Actual: 1 point
- Variance: Accurate
