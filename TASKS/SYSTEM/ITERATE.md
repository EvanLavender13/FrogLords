# ITERATE - Refine What Works

**Graybox proved it can work. Iteration proves it should exist.**

---

## Purpose

Refine crude but correct implementation into quality code. Simplify architecture. Extract patterns. Harden through playtesting. Prepare for external validation.

---

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Graybox functional
- [ ] `PLANS/<name>_SYSTEM.md` exists with GRAYBOX/RESULTS

---

## Anti-Patterns

Review @TASKS/PATTERNS.md for known anti-patterns.

Prevention is cheaper than detection.

**Documentation-only changes:** Do not create iterations for doc sync. Edit system doc directly and commit.

---

## Context Selection

Review @TASKS/CONTEXT/INDEX.md to identify relevant architectural patterns.

Use tags to find applicable context cards before beginning refinement.

---

## Process

### 1. Create or Resume Iteration Document

**Check for existing iterations:**

Find all iteration documents for this system:
```bash
ls PLANS/<name>_ITERATION_*.md
```

**If no iterations exist:**

Create `PLANS/<name>_ITERATION_1.md`.

**If iterations exist:**

Find highest iteration number N, read `PLANS/<name>_ITERATION_<N>.md` for VALIDATE/DECISION.

Create `PLANS/<name>_ITERATION_<N+1>.md`.

Add to iteration doc:

```markdown
<!-- BEGIN: ITERATE/CONTEXT -->
[Decision from previous iteration, required changes]
<!-- END: ITERATE/CONTEXT -->
```

---

### 2. External Review (ITERATION_1 only)

Skip if resuming from VALIDATE/REVISE.

Use Codex to review graybox code:

```bash
bash scripts/bash/codex.sh "TASKS/PLANS/<name>_SYSTEM.md PRINCIPLES.md CONVENTIONS.md TASKS/PATTERNS.md TASKS/CONTEXT/INDEX.md [relevant files] [your review prompt]"
```

**IMPORTANT:** Use `run_in_background: true` in Bash tool call.

Continue to internal review while external review runs.

---

### 3. Internal Review (ITERATION_1 only)

Skip if resuming from VALIDATE/REVISE.

Review graybox code while external review runs.

Add to iteration doc:

```markdown
<!-- BEGIN: ITERATE/INTERNAL_REVIEW -->
[Internal review findings]
<!-- END: ITERATE/INTERNAL_REVIEW -->
```

**After completing internal review, WAIT for user confirmation that external review is complete.** This takes several minutes. Do NOT monitor output. User will confirm when finished.

Continue conversation with external review if needed:
```bash
bash scripts/bash/codex.sh --resume "[follow-up question]"
```

Add external review to iteration doc:

```markdown
<!-- BEGIN: ITERATE/EXTERNAL_REVIEW -->
[External review findings]
<!-- END: ITERATE/EXTERNAL_REVIEW -->
```

---

### 4. Define Refinement Scope

Based on internal and external review findings, define actionable refinement goals.

Add to iteration doc:

```markdown
<!-- BEGIN: ITERATE/SCOPE -->
[Actionable refinement goals based on review findings]
<!-- END: ITERATE/SCOPE -->
```

---

### 5. Refine Code

Address findings from reviews and scope. Work incrementally. Build after each change. Commit when complete.

Add to iteration doc:

```markdown
<!-- BEGIN: ITERATE/REFINEMENT -->
[What changed in the code]
<!-- END: ITERATE/REFINEMENT -->
```

---

### 6. Playtest

Harden through use.

**Playtest workflow:**

1. Build
2. Claude presents test scenarios
3. User tests and reports
4. Violations found? Fix â†’ rebuild â†’ retest
5. All stable? Commit

Repeat until stable.

Add to iteration doc (multiple playtest sections allowed):

```markdown
<!-- BEGIN: ITERATE/PLAYTEST -->
[Playtest findings and fixes]
<!-- END: ITERATE/PLAYTEST -->
```

Stop when stable through multiple sessions.

---

### 7. Commit

Commit iteration document:

```bash
git add PLANS/<name>_ITERATION_<N>.md
git commit -m "iterate: <name> iteration <N> complete

ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com)"
```

---

## Outputs

- [ ] Internal review completed
- [ ] External review completed (ITERATION_1 only)
- [ ] Scope defined
- [ ] Code refined
- [ ] Stable through playtests
- [ ] Committed
- [ ] Ready for VALIDATE

---

## Next

â†’ VALIDATE (external principle review)

**Defer if:**
- Refinement reveals fundamental flaws
- Architecture cannot be salvaged
- System should not exist

---

**Crude code validates the idea. Refined code validates the implementation.**
