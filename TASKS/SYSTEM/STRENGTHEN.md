# STRENGTHEN - Close the Cycle

**Document learning. Update foundation. Celebrate emergence. Enable the next layer.**

---

## Purpose

Close the system-building cycle by capturing all learning, updating foundation certainty, and enabling future systems that can now be built on this solid ground.

**Every system teaches. This step ensures we remember the lessons.**

---

### 2. Update Dependency Stack

Open `TASKS/DEPENDENCY_STACK.md` and update:

**This layer:**
```markdown
## Layer [N]: [LAYER_NAME]

**Certainty:** [NEW_%]
**Last Updated:** [TODAY]

**Systems at this layer:**
- [Existing systems]
- **[NEW SYSTEM]** ‚Üê Just completed

**Foundation status:**
- [x] System [new] added
- [ ] Layer certainty recalculated
- [ ] Cascade to dependent layers calculated
```

**Calculate cascade:**
If this layer is now 90% certain:
- Next layer certainty = 0.9 √ó [next layer score]
- Layer after = 0.9¬≤ √ó [that layer score]
- Continue upward

**Update each dependent layer with cascaded certainty.**

---

### 3. Update System Backlog

Open `TASKS/BACKLOG_SYSTEMS.md`:

**Move completed system:**
```markdown
## Recently Completed

- **[SYSTEM NAME]**: [Description]
  - Completed: [Date]
  - Layer: [N]
  - Certainty contribution: +[%]
  - Emerged: [Key behaviors]
  - Enables: [Future systems]
```

**Update "Buildable Now" sections:**

For each layer that now has ‚â•90% foundation:
- Move systems from "Waiting on [dependencies]" to "Buildable Now"
- Note which dependency was just satisfied

**Add discovered opportunities:**
```markdown
## [Appropriate Layer]

**Buildable Now:**
- **[NEW OPPORTUNITY]**: [Discovered during <system>]
  - Depends on: [Including system we just built]
  - Enables: [Emergent possibilities]
  - Certainty needed: [%]
```

---

### 4. Update Refinement Backlog

Open `TASKS/BACKLOG_REFINEMENTS.md`:

**Add any violations discovered during building:**
```markdown
## Discovered During System Building

- **[LOCATION]**: [Violation found while building <system>]
  - Principle: [Which pillar]
  - Severity: [Level]
  - Fix: [Delete | Simplify | Document]
  - Found: [During which phase]
```

**Note patterns:**
```markdown
## Patterns

**Recurring violations:**
- [If this is the Nth time we've seen this violation type]
- Pattern: [Description]
- Root cause: [Why does this keep happening?]
- Prevention: [How to avoid in future systems?]
```

---

### 5. Celebrate Emergence

**Create a lightweight emergence log:**

In `EMERGENCE.md` (create if doesn't exist):
```markdown
# Emergence Log

**Systems that surprised their creators**

---

## [System Name] - [Date]

**We built:** [Simple description]

**We expected:** [What we thought would happen]

**What emerged:**
1. **[Behavior 1]**: [Description + why it's cool]
2. **[Behavior 2]**: [Description + why it's cool]
3. **[Behavior 3]**: [Description + why it's cool]

**Player strategies we didn't design:**
-
-

**Future possibilities this enables:**
-
-

**Quote from playtest:**
> [Something a playtester said that captured the magic]

**Principle alignment:**
- This validates: [Which principle]
- Score: __/10 on Emergent Behavior

---
```

**This is your win condition. Document it.**

## The Foundation Recalculation

### Before This System

```
Layer [N]: [BEFORE_%]
```

### After This System

**Recalculate this layer:**
1. Score system 1-10 on each principle (from VALIDATE.md)
2. Average all systems at this layer
3. Convert to percentage (√ó 10)

**Example:**
- System A scores: 8.5 avg ‚Üí 85%
- System B scores: 9.0 avg ‚Üí 90%
- System C scores: 7.5 avg ‚Üí 75%
- **Layer certainty: (85 + 90 + 75) / 3 = 83%**

### Cascade Upward

**Each dependent layer:**
Certainty = This layer certainty √ó Layer's own score

**Example cascade:**
- Layer 2: 90% certain
- Layer 3 own score: 80%
- Layer 3 final: 90% √ó 80% = 72%

**This is why we build bottom-up.**

---

## What This Enables

### Systems Now Buildable

**List all systems that:**
- Required this system as dependency
- Now have ‚â•90% foundation certainty
- Can be selected in next cycle

### Systems Now Closer

**List systems that:**
- Required this system
- Don't yet have ‚â•90% certainty
- Are closer to buildable

### Unexpected Opportunities

**List systems we didn't plan:**
- Discovered during emergence
- Enabled by surprising behaviors
- Added to backlog for future

---

## Metrics to Track

**Over time, watch trends:**

**Certainty trajectory:**
- Is foundation strengthening over time?
- Are we building bottom-up?
- Is cascade effect understood?

**Emergence rate:**
- How many emergent behaviors per system?
- Are we enabling or prescribing?
- Surprises increasing or decreasing?

**Iteration efficiency:**
- Cycles per system trending?
- Deferral rate healthy (20-40%)?
- Playtests revealing patterns faster?

**Principle alignment:**
- Average scores trending up?
- Specific principles consistently weak?
- Systems getting simpler over time?

---

## Next Step

**‚Üí SELECT** (choose next system from newly buildable options)

**OR**

**‚Üí REFINE** (if violations accumulated, strengthen foundation)

**The cycle continues. Build ‚Üí Strengthen ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Refine ‚Üí Build...**

---

## The Strengthening Philosophy

### Every System Is a Teacher

**We don't just build systems. We learn from them.**

- What surprised us?
- What was harder than expected?
- What emerged unexpectedly?
- What would we change?

**Document everything. Wisdom compounds.**

### Foundation Is Everything

**A 95% certain foundation can support anything.**
**A 60% certain foundation will collapse under its own weight.**

Every system either:
- Strengthens foundation (good)
- Weakens foundation (tech debt)
- Maintains foundation (neutral)

**Build to strengthen. Always.**

### Celebrate Emergence

**Emergence is the win condition.**

If a system doesn't surprise you, it's probably:
- Too simple (not a system)
- Too prescriptive (not enabling)
- Too early (foundation insufficient)

**When players discover strategies you didn't design, you've succeeded.**

### The Cycle Never Ends

**There is no "done." There is only:**
- Systems that strengthen foundation
- Systems that reveal opportunities
- Systems that enable emergence

**Build ‚Üí Strengthen ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Refine ‚Üí Build...**

**This is the way.**

---

**Document learning. Update foundation. Celebrate emergence. Enable the next layer.**
