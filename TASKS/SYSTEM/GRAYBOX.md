# GRAYBOX - Build Simplest Possible Version

**Validate with cubes. Prove it works before polish.**

---

## Purpose

Build the core mechanic in the simplest possible form. Prove it works mathematically. Make state visible through debug visualization.

**Crude but correct. Architecture refinement happens in ITERATE.**

If it doesn't work in graybox, it won't work polished. Save months by discovering this in hours.

---

## Prerequisites

- `PLANS/<name>_SYSTEM.md` exists with core identified
- Branch `system/<name>` active
- Dependencies exist (check DEPENDENCY_STACK.md)
- Mathematical approach clear

---

## Anti-Patterns

Before implementing, review @TASKS/PATTERNS.md for known code and process anti-patterns.

Prevention is cheaper than detection.

---

## Process

### 1. Define Scope

Update `PLANS/<name>_SYSTEM.md` â€” add:

```markdown
<!-- BEGIN: GRAYBOX/SCOPE -->
## Graybox

Define the minimal scope that proves the core works.

**What will be built:**
[Describe the core mechanic and how it will be validated]

**Complexity:** Small | Medium | Large
<!-- END: GRAYBOX/SCOPE -->
```

---

### 2. Plan Implementation

**Before writing code, map the structure.**

Study existing patterns in similar systems first. Identify reusable patterns before inventing new ones.

Update `PLANS/<name>_SYSTEM.md` â€” add:

```markdown
<!-- BEGIN: GRAYBOX/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN -->
## Implementation Plan

**Files to modify:**
List each file path and what changes.

**Call structure:**
Describe function call chain.

**Debug data flow:**
Describe how computed values reach visualization.

**Integration points:**
Identify which existing functions modified and where new code added.
<!-- END: GRAYBOX/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN -->
```

---

### 3. Implement Core and Debug Visualization

**Prove correctness. Make it visible. Don't overthink architecture.**

- Implement primitive/system code (simplest approach that works)
- Add debug visualization (make state visible)
- Add debug assertions for preconditions/postconditions
- Build successfully

**Architecture will be refined in ITERATE. Focus on functional correctness.**

---

### 4. Provide Testing Instructions

**DO NOT run the application. Provide instructions and wait for user to test.**

Present testing instructions covering:
- How to build and run
- What behaviors to validate
- Expected outcomes
- Edge cases to check

Wait for user to report results.

---

### 5. Iterate Based on Feedback

User reports: works, broken, or surprises.

**If broken:** Fix, rebuild, provide new instructions, repeat step 4.

**If works:** Proceed to document results.

---

### 6. Document Results

In `PLANS/<name>_SYSTEM.md` â€” add:

```markdown
<!-- BEGIN: GRAYBOX/RESULTS -->
## Results

**Status:**
- [x] Core functional
- [x] Build successful
- [x] Debug viz working
- [x] Ready for ITERATE

**Works:**
- [what functions correctly]

**Doesn't:**
- [known issues or limitations]

**Surprises:**
- [unexpected behaviors]

**Next:**
- ITERATE (code refinement and playtesting)
<!-- END: GRAYBOX/RESULTS -->
```

Update `CURRENT_PLAN.md` phase: `GRAYBOX â†’ ITERATE`

---

### 7. Commit

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "graybox: <name> core mechanic

Works: <what>
Validated: <properties>
Emergent: <surprises>
Status: <ready | needs work | defer>

## Outputs

- [ ] Implementation plan documented
- [ ] Core implemented (primitives)
- [ ] Debug viz functional
- [ ] Build successful
- [ ] Results documented
- [ ] Committed

---

## Next

**â†’ ITERATE** (if core works)

**Defer if:**
- Core fundamentally flawed
- Math doesn't work as expected
- Too complex to simplify
- Foundation insufficient
- Different approach needed

**Deferral is success. Most systems should fail in graybox. That's why we graybox.**

---

**Cheap to build. Cheap to change. Cheap to throw away. Validate with cubes.**
