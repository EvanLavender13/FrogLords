# Current Plan

**Status:** ✅ Refinement Complete
**Last Completed:** 2025-10-18 - Buffer Creation

---

## Ready for Next Task

**Choose next action:**
- `/REFINE/SELECT` - Pick next violation to fix
- `/SYSTEM/SELECT` - Pick next system to build

---

## Quick Reference

**Foundation:** 96.5% ✅ TARGET EXCEEDED
**Target:** 95% (Layer 3)

**Layer Status:**
- Layer 1 (Core): 95% ✅ - Target reached
- Layer 2 (Primitives): 100% ✅ - Complete
- Layer 3 (Systems): 97% ✅ - Target exceeded
- Layer 4 (Variation): <50% ✅ - Ready to build

**Next Priority:** Build Layer 4 systems - foundation solid (92.2% survival)
**Estimated Path:** 4-5 systems to reach Layer 4 at 95%

## Recent Milestone

**Buffer Creation Fixed (2025-10-18)**
- Replaced per-draw buffer creation with persistent dynamic buffers
- Rendering: Radical Simplicity 6/10 → 9/10 (+3.0)
- Foundation: 96% → 96.5% (+0.5%)
- 5 violations remaining (0 high, 2 medium, 3 low)

**Impact:** Layer 2 primitives now complete at 100%
