# Current Plan

**Status:** âœ… Refinement Complete
**Last Completed:** 2025-10-18 - Gradient Continuity

---

## Recommended Next Action

**ðŸ“Š RETRO recommended** - 6 plans completed since start
**Run:** Review TASKS/RETRO.md and extract patterns

**Or proceed with:**
- `/REFINE/SELECT` - Pick next violation to fix
- `/SYSTEM/SELECT` - Pick next system to build

## Quick Reference

**Foundation:** 97% âœ… TARGET EXCEEDED
**Target:** 95% (Layer 3)

**Layer Status:**
- Layer 1 (Core): 95.5% âœ… - Target exceeded
- Layer 2 (Primitives): 100% âœ… - Complete
- Layer 3 (Systems): 97% âœ… - Target exceeded
- Layer 4 (Variation): <50% âœ… - Ready to build

**Next Priority:** Build Layer 4 systems - foundation solid (92.6% survival)
**Estimated Path:** 4-5 systems to reach Layer 4 at 95%
