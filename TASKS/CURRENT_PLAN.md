# Current Plan

**Status:** ✅ Refinement Complete
**Last Completed:** 2025-10-18 - World Geometry Duplication

---

## Ready for Next Task

**Choose next action:**
- `/REFINE/SELECT` - Pick next violation to fix
- `/SYSTEM/SELECT` - Pick next system to build

---

## Quick Reference

**Foundation:** 95.5% ✅ TARGET EXCEEDED
**Target:** 95% (Layer 3)

**Layer Status:**
- Layer 1 (Core): 95% ✅ - Target reached
- Layer 2 (Primitives): 100% ✅ - Complete
- Layer 3 (Systems): 96% ✅ - Target exceeded
- Layer 4 (Variation): <50% ✅ - Ready to build

**Next Priority:** Fix high-priority violation (#1: Character State Management) OR Build Layer 4 systems
**Estimated Path:** 1 high-priority refinement, then 4-5 systems to reach Layer 4 at 95%

## Recent Milestone

**Foundation exceeded 95% target!**

- Layer 3: 95% → 96% (world geometry duplication removed)
- Overall: 95% → 95.5% (+0.5%)
- Cascade: 90.25% → 91.2% survival (+0.95%)

**Impact:** Layer 4 now has even stronger foundation (91.2% survival)
