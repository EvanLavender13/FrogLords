# Current Plan

**Status:** ðŸ”§ Refinement - Collision Responsibilities
**Started:** 2025-10-18
**Branch:** refine/collision_responsibilities
**Path:** B (Standard)
**Phase:** SELECT â†’ REFINE

---

## Current Work

**Refinement:** Split collision resolution from state interpretation
**Location:** @TASKS/PLANS/REFINE_collision_responsibilities.md
**Principle:** Composable Functions
**Approach:** Simplify - Split responsibilities
**Next:** REFINE

**Target Impact:**
- Layer 2: Composable Functions 6/10 â†’ 9/10 (+3.0)
- Overall: 97%+ maintained (orthogonality restored)
- Enables: Alternative movement systems (wall-run, magnetic boots, etc.)

---

## Quick Reference

**Foundation:** 97%+ âœ… TARGET EXCEEDED
**Target:** 95% (Layer 3)

**Layer Status:**
- Layer 1 (Core): 95.5% âœ… - Target exceeded
- Layer 2 (Primitives): 100% âœ… - Complete
- Layer 3 (Systems): 97%+ âœ… - Target exceeded
- Layer 4 (Variation): <50% âœ… - Ready to build

**Next Priority:** Collision responsibilities (#3) - Composability issue
**Estimated Path:** 1 high-priority refinement remaining, OR proceed to Layer 4 build
