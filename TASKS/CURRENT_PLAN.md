# Current Plan

**Status:** ðŸ”§ Refinement - GUI Coupling
**Started:** 2025-10-18
**Branch:** refine/gui_coupling
**Path:** B (Standard)
**Phase:** SELECT â†’ REFINE

---

## Current Work

**Refinement:** GUI direct manipulation of game state violates unidirectional data flow
**Location:** @TASKS/PLANS/REFINE_gui_coupling.md
**Principle:** Composable Functions, Principled Development
**Approach:** Simplify (command pattern for unidirectional flow)
**Next:** `/REFINE` (Path B - Standard complexity)

**Target Impact:**
- GUI: Composable Functions 6/10 â†’ 9/10 (+3)
- Overall: 97%+ â†’ 97%+ (architectural integrity maintained)

---

## Quick Reference

**Foundation:** 97%+ âœ… TARGET EXCEEDED
**Target:** 95% (Layer 3)

## Quick Reference

**Foundation:** 97%+ âœ… TARGET EXCEEDED
**Target:** 95% (Layer 3)

**Layer Status:**
- Layer 1 (Core): 95.5% âœ… - Target exceeded
- Layer 2 (Primitives): 100% âœ… - Complete
- Layer 3 (Systems): 97%+ âœ… - Target exceeded
- Layer 4 (Variation): <50% âœ… - Ready to build

**Next Priority:** GUI coupling (#1) - Architectural violation
**Estimated Path:** 2 high-priority refinements remaining, OR proceed to Layer 4 build
