# Current Plan

**Status:** ✅ Refinement Complete
**Last Completed:** 2025-10-18 - Embedded Tests

## Ready for Next Task

**Choose next action:**
- `/REFINE/SELECT` - Pick next violation to fix
- `/SYSTEM/SELECT` - Pick next system to build

## Quick Reference

**Foundation:** 97% ✅ TARGET EXCEEDED
**Target:** 95% (Layer 3)

**Layer Status:**
- Layer 1 (Core): 95.5% ✅ - Target exceeded
- Layer 2 (Primitives): 100% ✅ - Complete
- Layer 3 (Systems): 97% ✅ - Target exceeded
- Layer 4 (Variation): <50% ✅ - Ready to build

**Next Priority:** Build Layer 4 systems - foundation solid (92.6% survival)
**Estimated Path:** 4-5 systems to reach Layer 4 at 95%
