# Current Plan

**Status:** ðŸ”§ Refinement - Division by Zero
**Started:** 2025-10-18
**Branch:** refine/division_by_zero
**Path:** A (Trivial)
**Phase:** SELECT â†’ REFINE

---

## Current Work

**Refinement:** Critical division by zero bug in collision detection
**Location:** @TASKS/PLANS/REFINE_division_by_zero.md
**Principle:** Solid Mathematical Foundations
**Approach:** Delete (unsafe division)
**Next:** REFINE

**Violation:**
- `src/foundation/collision.cpp:25-29`
- Division by zero when sphere center inside/on AABB
- NaN propagation â†’ state corruption â†’ physics explosion

**Target Impact:**
- Layer 2 (Primitives): Critical bug fix (stability improvement)
- Overall: 97% â†’ 97%+ (critical bug eliminated)

---

## Quick Reference

**Foundation:** 97% âœ… TARGET EXCEEDED
**Target:** 95% (Layer 3)

**Layer Status:**
- Layer 1 (Core): 95.5% âœ… - Target exceeded
- Layer 2 (Primitives): 100% âœ… - Complete
- Layer 3 (Systems): 97% âœ… - Target exceeded
- Layer 4 (Variation): <50% âœ… - Ready to build

**Next Priority:** Build Layer 4 systems - foundation solid (92.6% survival)
**Estimated Path:** 4-5 systems to reach Layer 4 at 95%

## Recent Refinements

**Gradient Continuity (2025-10-18)**
- Replaced discontinuous branching with continuous interpolation
- Mathematical Foundations: 7/10 â†’ 9/10 (+2.0)
- Foundation: 97% (unchanged - debug visualization only)
- 3 violations remaining (0 high, 2 medium, 1 low)

**Embedded Tests Removed (2025-10-18)**
- Deleted test execution logic from runtime initialization
- Runtime: Composable Functions 8/10 â†’ 10/10 (+2.0)
- Foundation: 96.5% â†’ 97% (+0.5%)
