# Current Plan

**Status:** ðŸ”§ Refinement - Mouse Camera Jump
**Started:** 2025-10-18
**Branch:** refine/mouse_camera_jump
**Path:** A (trivial)
**Phase:** SELECT â†’ REFINE

---

## Current Work

**Refinement:** Delete stale mouse delta accumulation to prevent camera jump
**Location:** @TASKS/PLANS/REFINE_mouse_camera_jump.md
**Principle:** Prime Directive (Do No Harm to Gameplay), Consistency
**Approach:** Delete
**Next:** REFINE

**Target Impact:**
- Runtime/Camera: Predictable behavior restored
- Prime Directive: Violation eliminated
- Foundation: 97%+ maintained (user experience fix)

---

## Quick Reference

**Foundation:** 97%+ âœ… TARGET EXCEEDED
**Target:** 95% (Layer 3)

**Layer Status:**
- Layer 1 (Core): 95.5% âœ… - Target exceeded
- Layer 2 (Primitives): 100% âœ… - Complete
- Layer 3 (Systems): 97%+ âœ… - Target exceeded
- Layer 4 (Variation): <50% âœ… - Ready to build

**Next Priority:** Build Layer 4 systems - foundation solid (92.6%+ survival)
**Estimated Path:** 4-5 systems to reach Layer 4 at 95%

## Recent Refinements

**Division by Zero (2025-10-18)**
- Replaced unsafe division with safe normalization (UP fallback)
- Mathematical Foundations: CRITICAL â†’ 10/10 (+CRITICAL FIX)
- Foundation: 97% â†’ 97%+ (critical bug eliminated)
- 11 violations remaining (0 critical, 3 high, 5 medium, 3 low)

**Gradient Continuity (2025-10-18)**
- Replaced discontinuous branching with continuous interpolation
- Mathematical Foundations: 7/10 â†’ 9/10 (+2.0)
- Foundation: 97% (unchanged - debug visualization only)

**Embedded Tests Removed (2025-10-18)**
- Deleted test execution logic from runtime initialization
- Runtime: Composable Functions 8/10 â†’ 10/10 (+2.0)
- Foundation: 96.5% â†’ 97% (+0.5%)
