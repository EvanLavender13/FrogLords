# Current Plan

**Status:** ✅ Refinement Complete
**Last Completed:** 2025-10-18 - Accumulated State Pattern

---

## Ready for Next Task

**Choose next action:**
- `/SYSTEM/SELECT` - Pick next system to build (Layer 4 unblocked!)
- `/REFINE/SELECT` - Pick optional refinement (95% → 100%)

**Recommendation:** Build Layer 4 systems now that foundation is at 95%

---

## Quick Reference

**Foundation:** 95% ✅ TARGET REACHED
**Cascade:** 90.25% survival (excellent for variation)

**Layer Status:**
- Layer 1 (Core): 95% ✅ - Target reached
- Layer 2 (Primitives): 100% ✅ - Complete
- Layer 3 (Systems): 95% ✅ - Complete
- Layer 4 (Variation): <50% ✅ - Ready to build

**Next Priority:** Build Layer 4 systems (skeletal animation, walk/run states, wall sliding, dash)
**Estimated Path:** ~4-5 systems to reach Layer 4 at 95%

---

## Recent Milestone

**Foundation reached 95%!**

- Layer 1: 90% → 95% (accumulated state pattern documented)
- Overall: 92.5% → 95% (+2.5%)
- Cascade: 85.5% → 90.25% survival (+4.75%)

**Impact:** Layer 4 now has excellent foundation (90.25% survival)
