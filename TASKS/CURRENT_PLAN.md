# Current Plan

**Status:** ✅ Refinement Complete
**Last Completed:** 2025-10-18 - Mouse Camera Jump

---

## Ready for Next Task

**Choose next action:**
- `/REFINE/SELECT` - Pick next violation to fix
- `/SYSTEM/SELECT` - Pick next system to build

---

## Quick Reference

**Foundation:** 97%+ ✅ TARGET EXCEEDED
**Target:** 95% (Layer 3)

**Layer Status:**
- Layer 1 (Core): 95.5% ✅ - Target exceeded
- Layer 2 (Primitives): 100% ✅ - Complete
- Layer 3 (Systems): 97%+ ✅ - Target exceeded
- Layer 4 (Variation): <50% ✅ - Ready to build

**Next Priority:** GUI coupling (#1) - Architectural violation
**Estimated Path:** 2 high-priority refinements remaining, OR proceed to Layer 4 build
