# Current Plan

**Status:** ✅ Refinement Complete
**Last Completed:** 2025-10-18 - Division by Zero

---

## Ready for Next Task

**Choose next action:**
- `/REFINE/SELECT` - Pick next violation to fix
- `/SYSTEM/SELECT` - Pick next system to build

---

## Quick Reference

**Foundation:** 97%+ ✅ TARGET EXCEEDED
**Target:** 95% (Layer 3)

**Layer Status:**
- Layer 1 (Core): 95.5% ✅ - Target exceeded
- Layer 2 (Primitives): 100% ✅ - Complete
- Layer 3 (Systems): 97%+ ✅ - Target exceeded
- Layer 4 (Variation): <50% ✅ - Ready to build

**Next Priority:** Build Layer 4 systems - foundation solid (92.6%+ survival)
**Estimated Path:** 4-5 systems to reach Layer 4 at 95%

## Recent Refinements

**Division by Zero (2025-10-18)**
- Replaced unsafe division with safe normalization (UP fallback)
- Mathematical Foundations: CRITICAL → 10/10 (+CRITICAL FIX)
- Foundation: 97% → 97%+ (critical bug eliminated)
- 11 violations remaining (0 critical, 3 high, 5 medium, 3 low)

**Gradient Continuity (2025-10-18)**
- Replaced discontinuous branching with continuous interpolation
- Mathematical Foundations: 7/10 → 9/10 (+2.0)
- Foundation: 97% (unchanged - debug visualization only)

**Embedded Tests Removed (2025-10-18)**
- Deleted test execution logic from runtime initialization
- Runtime: Composable Functions 8/10 → 10/10 (+2.0)
- Foundation: 96.5% → 97% (+0.5%)
