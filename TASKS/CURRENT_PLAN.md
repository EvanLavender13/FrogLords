# Current Plan

**Status:** ✅ Refinement Complete
**Last Completed:** 2025-10-18 - Character State Management

---

## Ready for Next Task

**Choose next action:**
- `/SYSTEM/SELECT` - Build Layer 4 variation system ← **RECOMMENDED**
- `/REFINE/SELECT` - Fix medium-priority violation

---

## Quick Reference

**Foundation:** 96% ✅ TARGET EXCEEDED
**Target:** 95% (Layer 3)

**Layer Status:**
- Layer 1 (Core): 95% ✅ - Target reached
- Layer 2 (Primitives): 100% ✅ - Complete
- Layer 3 (Systems): 97% ✅ - Target exceeded
- Layer 4 (Variation): <50% ✅ - Ready to build

**Next Priority:** Build Layer 4 systems - foundation solid (92.2% survival)
**Estimated Path:** 4-5 systems to reach Layer 4 at 95%

---

## Recent Milestone

**All high-priority violations resolved!**

- Character state management: Unidirectional flow established
- Foundation: 95.5% → 96% (+0.5%)
- Layer 3: 96% → 97% (+1%)
- Cascade: 91.2% → 92.2% survival (+1%)

**Impact:** Layer 4 now has excellent foundation (92.2% survival)
