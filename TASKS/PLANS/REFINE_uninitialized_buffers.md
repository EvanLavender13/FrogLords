# Refinement: Uninitialized Buffers

Initialize renderer buffer members to match sokol handle pattern.

**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Complexity:** Trivial
**Path:** A (trivial)

<!-- BEGIN: SELECT/VIOLATION -->
## Violation

**Location:** `src/rendering/renderer.cpp:6`
**Principle:** Consistency
**Severity:** Medium
**Type:** Uninitialized members

**Current state:**
```cpp
wireframe_renderer::wireframe_renderer()
    : pipeline({0})
    , shader({0}) {}
```

Members `dynamic_vertex_buffer` and `dynamic_index_buffer` not in initializer list.

**Why violation:**
- Inconsistent with `pipeline` and `shader` initialization pattern
- Potential UB if accessed before `init()` call
- cppcheck flags as uninitMemberVar

**Impact:**
- Blocks: Safe construction guarantees
- Cascades to: None (isolated to renderer)
<!-- END: SELECT/VIOLATION -->

---

<!-- BEGIN: SELECT/FIX -->
## Fix

**Approach:** Simplify

**SIMPLIFY:**
- From: Partial member initialization (2 of 4 sokol handles)
- To: Complete member initialization (all sokol handles zero-initialized)
- Derive/Generalize: Match existing pattern for `pipeline` and `shader`
- Check duplicates: None - single initialization site
<!-- END: SELECT/FIX -->

---

<!-- BEGIN: REFINE/COMPLETED -->
## Completed

**Change:** Added `dynamic_vertex_buffer({0})` and `dynamic_index_buffer({0})` to constructor initializer list
**Files Modified:** `src/rendering/renderer.cpp:6-10` (added 2 initializers)
**Tests:** All passing
**Result:** ✓ Violation removed - all sokol handles now consistently zero-initialized
<!-- END: REFINE/COMPLETED -->

<!-- BEGIN: MEASURE/METRICS -->
## Metrics

**Files:**
- `src/rendering/renderer.cpp`: 118 → 120 (+2 lines)

**Total:** +2 lines (initialization added, not removal)

**Violations removed:**
- Uninitialized sokol handle members: 2 → 0 (-2)
- Class members: 4 total, 2 initialized → 4 initialized
<!-- END: MEASURE/METRICS -->

<!-- BEGIN: MEASURE/LEARNING -->
## Learning

**Root cause:** Constructor initialized only first 2 of 4 sokol handles, leaving buffers uninitialized.

**Prevention:** When adding members of the same type, initialize all consistently. Static analysis (cppcheck uninitMemberVar) catches this.

**Pattern:** Part of construction contract enforcement - all handles must start in valid zero state.
