# Iteration 2: Designer Parameter Interface

**Started:** 2025-10-22

<!-- BEGIN: ITERATE/CONTEXT -->
## Context from Previous Iteration

**Decision:** REVISE (from ITERATION_1)

**Required changes:**

1. Move derived parameter metadata (jump_velocity_meta) from character_panel.cpp to tuning.h alongside other metadata
2. Refactor tuning.cpp assertions to validate using metadata ranges (min/max) instead of hardcoded values
3. Remove param_meta.type field entirely—visual distinction comes from widget choice, not metadata flag

**Baseline contract:** See ITERATION_1/CONTRACT

## Foundation Contract

Principle violations from iteration 1 must be eliminated. Contract items trace to specific violations.

### Single Source of Truth
- [x] Derived metadata (jump_velocity) lives with data in tuning.h, not in GUI layer
  - Moved jump_velocity_meta from character_panel.cpp:52 to tuning.h:53
  - GUI now references character::tuning_params::jump_velocity_meta
  - Single source of truth: metadata lives with data struct
- [x] Runtime validation uses metadata ranges as single source, no hardcoded values
  - Refactored tuning.cpp assertions to use metadata min/max
  - Eliminated hardcoded validation values (e.g., "gravity < 0.0f")
  - Single source: metadata defines allowable domain, validation enforces it

### Radical Simplicity
- [x] param_meta.type field removed—unused ceremony eliminated
  - Removed param_type enum from param_meta.h
  - Removed type field from param_meta struct
  - Updated all metadata definitions (tuning.h, controller.h, camera_follow.h)
  - Visual distinction comes from widget choice, not metadata flag

### Regression Prevention
- [x] All iteration 1 functionality still works after changes
  - Character panel: all sliders, derived param, plots functional
  - Camera panel: all parameters tunable and persist correctly
  - No visual glitches or crashes
- [x] Mathematical correctness preserved (jump_velocity calculation)
  - Jump Velocity updates correctly when Jump Height or Gravity changes
  - Formula display remains correct: "sqrt(2*|g|*h)"
- [x] Visual hierarchy preserved (tunable vs derived distinction)
  - Tunable params: normal sliders with units
  - Derived param: grayed italic text with formula
  - Visual distinction clear without param_type field
- [x] Extensibility preserved (camera system still works)
  - All camera parameters display and function correctly
  - Pattern remains extensible to future systems

<!-- BEGIN: VALIDATE/REVIEW -->
## External Review

**Tool:** Codex
**Date:** 2025-10-22

**Principle Violations:**
- Single Source of Truth (minor): Derived widget label passed as explicit string (character_panel.cpp:52-54) can drift from jump_velocity_meta.name
- Mathematical Foundations/Consistency (minor): Camera panel allows min_distance > max_distance, which violates camera_follow::zoom invariant (camera_panel.cpp:62-66, camera_follow.cpp:39-50)

**Strengths:**
- All iteration 1 violations successfully eliminated (metadata co-location, validation from metadata ranges, param_type removal)
- Strong alignment with Radical Simplicity: param_meta carries only necessary fields, metadata-driven widgets minimize duplication
- Excellent Fundamental Composable Functions: param_meta as foundation primitive enables cross-system reuse without dependencies
- Solid Mathematical Foundations: preconditions tied to metadata ranges, jump velocity formula documented and asserted
- Good Emergent Behavior: histogram provides real-time feedback on parameter interplay, unidirectional command flow enables safe experimentation
- Strong Consistency: uniform slider formatting and visual treatment across panels, derived values consistently read-only

**Assessment:** System holds up well against all six pillars. Required fixes from iteration 1 are complete. Two minor residual issues identified are fixable and do not represent fundamental violations.

## Decision

**Status:** REVISE

**Reasoning:** All required fixes from iteration 1 successfully eliminated principle violations. System demonstrates strong alignment with all six pillars. However, two minor but real principle violations remain that should be addressed before approval:

1. Single Source of Truth: Label text duplicated between metadata and widget call
2. Mathematical Foundations/Consistency: GUI permits invalid parameter relationships that violate runtime invariants

Both violations are fixable without restructuring. Core system is sound and ready for final polish.

**Required changes:**
1. Refactor widget::derived_param to pull display label from param_meta.name instead of accepting explicit string parameter (eliminates label duplication at character_panel.cpp:52-54)
2. Add camera panel validation to prevent min_distance > max_distance (enforce invariant in GUI before commands fire, preventing runtime assert at camera_follow.cpp:39-50)
<!-- END: VALIDATE/DECISION -->
