## Dependencies

**Required (≥90%):**
- Collision System: 100% ✅
- Controller: 97% ✅
- Debug Visualization: 100% ✅

**Enables (will become buildable):**
- Wall-running mechanic

<!-- END: SELECT/DEPENDENCIES -->

<!-- BEGIN: SELECT/CORE -->
## Core

**Irreducible minimum:**
Classify collision surfaces by normal (wall vs floor vs ceiling). When hitting a wall, project movement vector along the wall surface instead of stopping. Preserve player control throughout.

**Why a system, not a feature:**
This establishes the foundation for how characters interact with vertical geometry. It enables emergent navigation patterns (corner sliding, wall approach angles) and future mechanics (wall-running, climbing) without special cases.
<!-- END: SELECT/CORE -->

<!-- BEGIN: SELECT/MATHEMATICAL_FOUNDATION -->
## Mathematical Foundation

**Provable correctness:**
- Surface classification: `dot(normal, up_vector)` → wall if abs(dot) < threshold
- Velocity projection: `velocity - normal * dot(velocity, normal)` → tangent velocity
- Edge case: Multiple simultaneous wall contacts → average normals before projection

**Known uncertainties:**
- Optimal threshold for wall vs slope classification (likely 0.707 = 45°)
- Handling inside corners (two opposing wall normals)
- Transition behavior when wall becomes slope

**Validation approach:**
- Unit tests for normal classification at boundary angles
- Debug visualization of collision normals and projected velocities
- Manual testing: approach walls at various angles, verify smooth sliding
<!-- END: SELECT/MATHEMATICAL_FOUNDATION -->

<!-- BEGIN: SELECT/GRAYBOX -->
## Graybox

**Simplest implementation:**
- Test level: Grid of vertical wall cubes + sloped surfaces at various angles
- Debug visuals: Collision normals (green = floor, red = wall, blue = ceiling)
- Debug visuals: Original velocity vector vs projected velocity vector
- Character controller: Existing capsule collision

**Validation:**
- Walk into wall at 90° → stop (no tangent component)
- Walk into wall at 45° → slide along wall
- Walk along wall-floor edge → maintain forward motion
- Walk into inside corner → graceful stop (opposing normals cancel)

<!-- BEGIN: GRAYBOX/RESULTS -->
## Graybox Results

**Status:**
- [x] Core functional
- [x] Math validation passing (build successful, debug validation passed)
- [x] Debug viz working (normals color-coded, velocity projection visible)
- [ ] Edge cases handled (needs playtesting)
- [ ] Emergence observed (needs playtesting)

**Implemented:**
- Surface classification: `is_wall()` uses dot product with threshold 0.707 (45°)
- Velocity projection: `project_along_wall()` removes normal component
- Integration: Modified `resolve_box_collisions()` to classify and project
- Debug visualization:
  - Normals: Red=wall, Green=floor, Blue=ceiling
  - Velocity vectors: Gray=original, Yellow=projected (walls only)

**Mathematical Foundation:**
- Classification: `abs(normal.y) < 0.707` → wall (vertical surface)
- Projection: `v_tangent = v - n * dot(v, n)` → preserves parallel motion
- Zero overhead: Classification happens during collision resolution (no extra passes)

**Next Steps:**
- Manual playtest: Walk into walls at various angles
- Validate: 90° → stop, 45° → smooth slide
- Test: Inside corners (opposing normals)
- Observe: Any emergent behaviors

**Build Status:**
```
Build: ✅ Success (16/16 compiled)
Debug: ✅ All validation checks passed
Run:   ✅ Program started successfully
```

## Foundation Contract

**Mathematical properties:**
- [x] Surface classification consistent: `abs(dot(normal, up)) < 0.707` always classifies 45°+ slopes as walls
- [x] Projection preserves tangent motion: `v_tangent = v - n * dot(v, n)` removes only normal component
- [x] Projection magnitude bounded: `|v_projected| ≤ |v_original|` (never amplifies velocity) ✓ Assertion added
- [x] Zero normal velocity after projection: `dot(v_projected, normal) ≈ 0` (within epsilon) ✓ Assertion added

**Edge cases:**
- [x] 90° wall collision (pure normal): projected velocity = zero (graceful stop) ✓ Math verified by assertion
- [x] Parallel to wall (pure tangent): projected velocity = original (no change) ✓ Math verified by assertion
- [x] Inside corner (opposing normals): multi-pass resolution handles opposing normals ✓ Implemented
- [x] Multiple simultaneous walls: 3-pass iteration resolves complex scenarios ✓ Implemented (collision.cpp:79)
- [x] Wall-to-floor transition: classification uses threshold 0.707 (45°) ✓ Implemented (collision.cpp:23)

**Consistency:**
- [x] Same input → same output (deterministic projection) ✓ Pure math, no state
- [x] Frame-rate independent (no velocity accumulation artifacts) ✓ Instantaneous projection, dt-scaled physics
- [x] No special cases (single projection formula for all walls) ✓ project_along_wall() uniform for all

### Playtest 1

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Tester:** User (developer)

**Violations:**
- [x] Cannot jump when running into wall (Prime Directive violation)

## External Review

**Date:** 2025-10-19

### Gemini Review

**Feedback:**
- Scores validated as accurate (9.3/10)
- No violations found
- Mathematical foundation sound
- Implementation is "model implementation that demonstrates mastery"
- Noted: `contacted_floor` persistence across passes is subtle but correct

**Assessment:** Approved all scores

### Codex Review

**Revised Scores:**
- Radical Simplicity: 9/10 (unchanged)
- Fundamental Composable Functions: 9/10 (↓ from 10)
- Solid Mathematical Foundations: 9/10 (↓ from 10)
- Emergent Behavior: 7/10 (↓ from 8)
- Consistency: 6/10 (↓ from 10) **CRITICAL**
- Principled Development: 7/10 (↓ from 9)

**Adjusted Average: 7.8/10**

**Critical Violations Identified:**

1. **Single Source of Truth breach** (Consistency violation):
   - `WALL_THRESHOLD = 0.707f` hardcoded in collision.cpp:14
   - `max_slope_angle` exposed in controller.h:100
   - Tuning gameplay slope angle silently does nothing - systems disagree on "wall vs floor"

2. **Plan-implementation mismatch** (Principled Development):
   - Plan promised normal averaging for simultaneous walls (wall_sliding_SYSTEM.md:53)
   - Implementation uses sequential iteration (collision.cpp:121-156)
   - Outcome is order-dependent, violates Consistency

3. **Degenerate contact handling** (Mathematical Foundations):
   - `safe_normalize` fallback to UP (math_utils.h:59-72)
   - Deep wall penetrations misclassified as floors (collision.cpp:19-25)
   - Can spike players upward instead of sliding

4. **Debug truthfulness** (Principled Development):
   - `final_contact` records only last contact (collision.cpp:148-153)
   - Floor+wall contacts appear as "wall" in UI
   - Obscures real grounding state during diagnosis

**Final scores:**
- Self-assessed: 9.3/10
- Gemini: 9.3/10 (validated)
- Codex: 7.8/10 (critical violations found)
- **Consensus: 7.8/10** (Codex identified objective violations)
<!-- END: VALIDATE/REVIEW -->

<!-- BEGIN: VALIDATE/DECISION -->
## Decision

**Status:** REVISE

**Reasoning:**
Average 7.8/10 with minimum score 6/10 technically meets APPROVED threshold (≥7.0, all ≥6). However, Consistency at 6/10 is borderline, and Codex identified objective principle violations that must be addressed:

**Critical issue** - Single Source of Truth violation:
- `WALL_THRESHOLD` hardcoded in collision system
- `max_slope_angle` exists in controller
- Systems will silently disagree if tuned

This violates Principle #1 (Simplicity), #5 (Consistency), and the Pattern "Single Source of Truth" (PRINCIPLES.md:68-69).

**Required changes:**

1. **Fix Single Source of Truth** (CRITICAL):
   - Derive WALL_THRESHOLD from authoritative slope angle
   - OR: Pass threshold into collision system as parameter
   - Ensure tuning one value updates both systems

2. **Address degenerate contact handling** (HIGH):
   - Validate safe_normalize fallback doesn't misclassify deep penetrations
   - Add assertion or alternative fallback for wall contacts

3. **Document plan deviation** (MEDIUM):
   - Sequential iteration vs normal averaging
   - Justify why sequential approach is correct
   - OR: Implement averaging as originally planned

4. **Fix debug visualization** (LOW):
   - Ensure final_contact represents combined state accurately
   - OR: Document that it shows last contact only

**Decision criteria:**
Despite meeting numerical threshold, principle violations (especially Single Source of Truth) indicate the system is not yet ready for integration. These issues will compound if left unfixed.

**Principles over shipping.**

## Implementation Notes

**Surface classification thresholds:**
```cpp
// dot(normal, up) interpretation:
//  1.0  = floor (upward normal)
//  0.0  = wall (horizontal normal)
// -1.0  = ceiling (downward normal)
constexpr float wall_threshold = 0.707f; // 45° slope

bool is_wall(vec3 normal) {
    return abs(dot(normal, vec3(0, 1, 0))) < wall_threshold;
}
```

**Velocity projection:**
```cpp
// Remove velocity component into wall normal
vec3 project_along_wall(vec3 velocity, vec3 wall_normal) {
    return velocity - wall_normal * dot(velocity, wall_normal);
}
```

**Multiple contact handling:**
```cpp
// Average normals if multiple walls hit simultaneously
vec3 combined_normal = normalize(normal_a + normal_b);
vec3 projected = project_along_wall(velocity, combined_normal);
```

**Integration point:**
Modify `controller::move()` collision response - classify surface, apply projection if wall detected.
