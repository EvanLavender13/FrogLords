# Iteration 2: Wall Sliding

**Started:** 2025-10-19
**Previous:** [ITERATION_1.md](wall_sliding_ITERATION_1.md)
**Status:** APPROVED

<!-- BEGIN: ITERATE/CONTEXT -->
## Context from Previous Iteration

**Decision:** REVISE (from ITERATION_1)

**Required changes:**

1. **Fix Single Source of Truth** (CRITICAL):
   - `WALL_THRESHOLD = 0.707f` hardcoded in collision.cpp
   - `max_slope_angle` exists in controller
   - Systems will silently disagree if tuned
   - Fix: Derive WALL_THRESHOLD from authoritative slope angle OR pass as parameter

2. **Address degenerate contact handling** (HIGH):
   - `safe_normalize` fallback to UP (math_utils.h:59-72)
   - Deep wall penetrations misclassified as floors
   - Can spike players upward instead of sliding
   - Fix: Validate fallback behavior, add assertion or alternative

3. **Document plan deviation** (MEDIUM):
   - Plan promised normal averaging (wall_sliding_SYSTEM.md:53)
   - Implementation uses sequential iteration
   - Fix: Justify sequential approach OR implement averaging

4. **Fix debug visualization** (LOW):
   - `final_contact` shows only last contact
   - Floor+wall contacts appear as "wall" in UI
   - Fix: Represent combined state OR document limitation

**Baseline contract:** See ITERATION_1/CONTRACT

**Previous scores:**
- Self: 9.3/10
- Gemini: 9.3/10
- Codex: 7.8/10 (critical violations)
- Consensus: 7.8/10

**Target:** Fix violations → achieve ≥8.5/10 average, all scores ≥7.0

## Foundation Contract

**Mathematical properties:**
- [x] Surface classification consistent: `abs(dot(normal, up)) < threshold` with single source threshold
  - Fixed (16d2e8b): Added `wall_threshold` parameter derived from `max_slope_angle`
  - Controller calculates once, collision system uses consistently
- [x] Projection preserves tangent motion: `v_tangent = v - n * dot(v, n)` removes only normal component ✓ (from ITERATION_1)
- [x] Projection magnitude bounded: `|v_projected| ≤ |v_original|` ✓ Assertion (from ITERATION_1)
- [x] Zero normal velocity after projection: `dot(v_projected, normal) ≈ 0` ✓ Assertion (from ITERATION_1)
- [x] Degenerate contacts handled: Deep penetrations don't misclassify or spike player
  - Fixed (0b6c09b): `compute_face_normal()` uses geometric context instead of UP fallback
  - Fallback respects actual contact surface (wall remains wall, floor remains floor)

**Edge cases:**
- [x] 90° wall collision (pure normal): projected velocity = zero ✓ (from ITERATION_1)
- [x] Parallel to wall (pure tangent): projected velocity = original ✓ (from ITERATION_1)
- [x] Inside corner (opposing normals): resolution handles correctly ✓ (from ITERATION_1)
- [x] Multiple simultaneous walls: iteration resolves complex scenarios
  - Documented (a0d88ed): Sequential iteration handles N-walls, deterministic
- [x] Wall-to-floor transition: single threshold value used consistently
  - Fixed (16d2e8b): Single source (`max_slope_angle` → `wall_threshold`)

**Consistency:**
- [x] Same input → same output ✓ (from ITERATION_1)
- [x] Frame-rate independent ✓ (from ITERATION_1)
- [x] No special cases ✓ (from ITERATION_1)
- [x] Single source of truth for all thresholds
  - Fixed (16d2e8b): Removed hardcoded `WALL_THRESHOLD`, derive from `max_slope_angle`
- [x] Radical Simplicity applied
  - Fixed (a0d88ed): Removed unused `velocity_before`/`velocity_after` debug fields

<!-- BEGIN: VALIDATE/SCORES -->
## Principle Scores

**1. Radical Simplicity:** 9/10
- Can anything be removed? Minimal implementation: dot product classification + vector projection
- Evidence: Core is 30 lines (is_wall + project_along_wall). No special cases. Single threshold parameter.
- Minor: Sequential iteration (3 passes) could theoretically be 1 pass, but handles N-wall contacts robustly

**2. Fundamental Composable Functions:** 10/10
- Are functions orthogonal? Yes - classification and projection are independent primitives
- Evidence: `is_wall()` classifies surfaces (pure function of normal + threshold). `project_along_wall()` projects velocity (pure function of velocity + normal). Each does one thing. They compose cleanly in collision loop.
- No dependencies between functions. No side effects. Perfect composition.

**3. Solid Mathematical Foundations:** 10/10
- Is the math correct? Yes - proven formulas with validation
- Evidence:
  - Classification: `abs(dot(normal, up)) < threshold` - standard surface angle test
  - Projection: `v - n * dot(v, n)` - standard vector projection formula
  - Assertions validate: no amplification, orthogonality, finite results
  - Playtest confirmed: smooth sliding, no spikes, correct behavior at all angles

**4. Emergent Behavior:** 8/10
- Does the system allow unexpected outcomes? Yes - corner sliding, angle-dependent speed
- Evidence: Simple rules (classify + project) create complex behaviors:
  - Grazing angles → maintains speed
  - Steep angles → slows naturally
  - Inside corners → graceful resolution
  - No authored outcomes - physics determines result
- Minor: Limited emergence scope (variation layer, not core mechanic)

**5. Consistency:** 10/10
- Same input → same output? Yes - deterministic, frame-independent
- Evidence:
  - Single source threshold (`max_slope_angle` → `wall_threshold`)
  - No special cases in projection math
  - Frame-rate independent (velocity-based, not position accumulation)
  - Playtested: identical behavior across runs
  - Sequential iteration is deterministic (fixed order, convergent)

**6. Principled Development:** 9/10
- Do decisions trace to principles? Yes - all major choices justified
- Evidence:
  - Single source of truth: Fixed hardcoded threshold (Iteration 1 violation)
  - Degenerate contacts: Fixed UP fallback to preserve surface type (Consistency)
  - Sequential iteration: Documented choice, industry standard (Simplicity > theoretical purity)
  - Debug assertions: Continuous validation (Mathematical Foundations)
- Minor: Iteration 1 had violations, but all fixed in Iteration 2

**Average:** 9.3/10

## External Review

**Tool:** Codex
**Date:** 2025-10-19

**Codex Scores:**
- Radical Simplicity: 9/10
- Fundamental Composable Functions: 10/10
- Solid Mathematical Foundations: 10/10
- Emergent Behavior: 8/10
- Consistency: 10/10
- Principled Development: 9/10
- **Average:** 9.3/10

**Key Feedback:**
- All Iteration 1 violations successfully fixed (single source, degenerate contacts, sequential iteration)
- `is_wall()` and `project_along_wall()` confirmed as orthogonal primitives with clean composition
- Mathematical formulas verified: standard dot product classification + vector projection
- Single source of truth: `max_slope_angle` → `wall_threshold` eliminates drift
- Degenerate normal handling: `compute_face_normal()` uses geometric context (no arbitrary UP fallback)
- Deterministic behavior: bounded passes, explicit flags, frame-independent
- Watch item: UP fallback in `compute_face_normal()` line 31 should never trigger (consider telemetry)

**Decision:** APPROVED

**Synthesis:**
Self-scores (9.3) and external review (9.3) converge perfectly. All major principle violations from Iteration 1 have been resolved. Implementation is minimal, mathematically sound, and consistently adheres to principles.

<!-- END: VALIDATE/DECISION -->

<!-- BEGIN: VALIDATE/TESTS -->
## Foundation Tests

**Status:** Not applicable

**Reasoning:**
Wall sliding functions (`is_wall()`, `project_along_wall()`) are:
1. Internal helpers (anonymous namespace, not public API)
2. Already validated by debug assertions (collision.cpp:54-76)
   - No amplification: `projected_mag <= original_mag + FL_EPSILON`
   - Orthogonality: `abs(dot(projected, normal)) < FL_EPSILON`
   - Finite results: `FL_ASSERT_FINITE(projected, "projected velocity")`
3. Continuously validated every frame during gameplay
4. Mathematically verified by external review (Codex: 10/10 on Mathematical Foundations)
5. Behaviorally proven through playtesting (all contract items pass)

Per CONVENTIONS.md: Foundation code validated through debug assertions + manual testing.
Unit tests reserved for exposed primitives requiring independent mathematical verification.

**Validation approach:** Runtime assertions + playtesting (already complete)
<!-- END: VALIDATE/TESTS -->

<!-- BEGIN: VALIDATE/EMERGENCE -->
## Emergence

**Surprising behaviors:**
- **Angle-dependent speed**: Approach wall at shallow angle → maintains most speed. Approach at 90° → stops. Not authored - emerges from projection geometry.
- **Corner navigation**: Inside corners (opposing normals) resolve through sequential iteration. No special case needed. Player slides in, velocity projects against each wall, natural stop.
- **Simultaneous floor+wall contacts**: Floor contact preserved via `contacted_floor` flag even when wall is final contact in iteration. Grounded state remains stable.

**Enables (future):**
- Wall-running (detect is_wall + sufficient speed)
- Climbing detection (wall contact + upward input)
- Wall-jumps (use wall normal for jump direction)
- Advanced traversal mechanics

**Learned:**
- External validation converged with self-assessment (both 9.3/10) - clear principles enable accurate self-evaluation
- Iteration fixed violations (7.8 → 9.3) - process works when principles are law
- Debug assertions = continuous validation. Caught edge cases during development.
- Single source of truth non-negotiable: Hardcoded threshold caused Iteration 1 failure
