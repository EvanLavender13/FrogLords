## Violation

**Location:** `src/character/tuning.cpp:8-38`
**Principle:** Mathematical Foundations | Score: 6/10
**Severity:** Medium
**Type:** Unjustified decision, Non-physical model

**Current state:**
```cpp
// Reverse-engineers friction from desired acceleration ratio
constexpr float FRICTION_RATIO = 0.75f;
constexpr float NET_FRACTION = 0.25f;

// Inflates ground_accel to compensate for friction
c.ground_accel = desired_accel / NET_FRACTION;  // 20 / 0.25 = 80 m/s²
c.friction = (c.ground_accel * FRICTION_RATIO) / gravity_mag;  // μ ≈ 6.12 (!!)
```

**Why violation:**
- Produces physically impossible friction coefficient (μ ≈ 6.12, real-world max ≈ 1.0)
- Backwards calculation: starts from desired ratio, derives friction
- Dimensionally strange: friction calculated from acceleration ratio
- No physical interpretation or real-world analogue
- Violates "Mathematics is truth, Physics is law" (Principle #3)

**Impact:**
- Blocks: Tuning predictability (can't reason about "0.75 friction ratio")
- Cascades to: All ground movement behavior
- Foundation: Layer 1 (Core) - affects character tuning certainty

## Fix

**Approach:** Simplify - Replace with standard kinetic friction

**Physical Model:**

Standard kinetic friction opposes motion:
```
F_friction = μ * |F_normal|
```

For ground movement (normal force = gravity):
```
F_friction = μ * m * |g|
a_friction = μ * |g|  (force per unit mass)
```

**Current System (Non-Physical):**
1. Choose FRICTION_RATIO = 0.75 (arbitrary)
2. Inflate ground_accel = 80 m/s² (to compensate for friction)
3. Calculate friction coefficient from ratio
4. Apply: decel = friction * |g| ≈ 6.12 * 9.8 ≈ 60 m/s²
5. Net result: 80 - 60 = 20 m/s² (desired acceleration)

**New System (Physical):**
1. Choose friction_coefficient μ = 0.7 (rubber-like, physically valid)
2. Set ground_accel = 20 m/s² directly (no inflation)
3. Apply: decel = μ * |g| = 0.7 * 9.8 ≈ 6.86 m/s²
4. Net result: Input-dependent (player controls acceleration, friction opposes)

**Key Difference:**
- **Current**: Friction is pre-baked into inflated acceleration
- **Physical**: Friction is independent force that opposes motion

**Implementation Changes:**

**1. tuning.h - Add friction parameter:**
```
Add tunable parameter:
  float friction_coefficient = 0.7f;  // dimensionless, range [0.0, 1.0]

Document physical meaning:
  - 0.0 = ice (no friction)
  - 0.7 = rubber on asphalt (snappy)
  - 1.0 = maximum practical friction
```

**2. tuning.cpp - Simplify apply_to():**
```
Remove:
  - FRICTION_RATIO constant
  - NET_FRACTION constant
  - Acceleration inflation logic

Change ground_accel calculation:
  From: c.ground_accel = desired_accel / NET_FRACTION;
  To:   c.ground_accel = desired_accel;

Change friction assignment:
  From: c.friction = (c.ground_accel * FRICTION_RATIO) / gravity_mag;
  To:   c.friction = friction_coefficient;
```

**3. controller.cpp - No changes needed:**
```
Friction application already physically correct:
  friction_decel = friction * |gravity| * dt

This now becomes:
  friction_decel = μ * |g| * dt  (standard kinetic friction!)
```

**Tuning Impact:**

Current feel comes from net 20 m/s² acceleration:
- ground_accel = 80 m/s² (inflated)
- friction_decel = 60 m/s² (huge)
- net = 20 m/s² when moving

New model with μ = 0.7:
- ground_accel = 20 m/s² (direct)
- friction_decel = 6.86 m/s² (realistic)
- net when accelerating = ~13 m/s² (faster)
- stopping behavior = 6.86 m/s² decel (gentler)

**To match current feel**, reduce ground_accel proportionally:
- If current net ≈ 20 m/s², set ground_accel ≈ 27 m/s² with μ = 0.7
- Or keep ground_accel = 20 m/s² and reduce μ to ~0.3 (more slippery)

**Tuning exploration needed** - try values and iterate.

## Refinement Plan

### Step 1: Add friction_coefficient to tuning.h
**Changes:** `src/character/tuning.h` - Add friction_coefficient parameter with physical meaning
**Files:**
- `src/character/tuning.h` - Add `float friction_coefficient = 0.7f;` with documentation
**Tests:** Build passes, structure unchanged
**Validation:** Parameter exists, documented, physically valid range

### Step 2: Simplify tuning.cpp friction calculation
**Changes:** `src/character/tuning.cpp:8-38` - Remove FRICTION_RATIO, NET_FRACTION, inflation logic
**From:**
```cpp
constexpr float FRICTION_RATIO = 0.75f;
constexpr float NET_FRACTION = 0.25f;
c.ground_accel = desired_accel / NET_FRACTION;  // Inflation
c.friction = (c.ground_accel * FRICTION_RATIO) / gravity_mag;  // Non-physical
```
**To:**
```cpp
c.ground_accel = desired_accel;  // Direct assignment
c.friction = friction_coefficient;  // Physical μ
```
**Tests:** Build passes, tests pass, friction coefficient in [0.0, 1.0]
**Validation:** No inflation logic, friction directly from parameter, physically valid

### Step 3: Verify controller.cpp unchanged
**Changes:** `src/character/controller.cpp` - Verify friction application is already physical
**Expected:** `friction_decel = friction * |gravity| * dt` (already correct)
**Tests:** All tests pass, no behavioral regressions
**Validation:** Friction application matches standard kinetic friction formula

### Step 4: Update controller.h documentation
**Changes:** `src/character/controller.h:64` - Remove NET_FRACTION references in ground_accel documentation
**From:** Documentation mentioning NET_FRACTION and 80 m/s²
**To:** Documentation reflecting direct acceleration assignment
**Tests:** Build passes
**Validation:** Documentation matches new tuning model (Single Source of Truth)

## Rollback
If tests fail or behavior breaks unacceptably:
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD
```
Or revert individual commits in reverse order.

## Second Opinion Review

**Tool:** Codex CLI
**Date:** 2025-10-18

**Question asked:**
"Review TASKS/PLANS/REFINE_friction_model.md and PRINCIPLES.md. Evaluate the refinement plan in the REFINE/PLAN section:
1. Does the approach correctly replace non-physical friction with standard kinetic friction?
2. Are there any risks or edge cases I should watch for?
3. Does the step-by-step plan align with the principles (especially Mathematical Foundations and Radical Simplicity)?
4. Any recommendations before I execute?"

**Concerns evaluated:**
- Correctness of physical friction model replacement
- Edge cases and risks (parameter validation, documentation consistency)
- Principle alignment (Mathematical Foundations, Radical Simplicity)
- Missing steps in execution plan

**Feedback received:**
1. Core approach is correct - μ in tuning → friction becomes μ·|g| (standard kinetic friction) ✓
2. Key risks identified:
   - `controller.h:64` still documents ground_accel with NET_FRACTION/80 m/s² (violates Single Source of Truth)
   - Early-return in `tuning.cpp:27` on `time_to_max_speed <= 0` skips friction assignment
   - gravity_mag still needed for jump_velocity calculation (don't accidentally remove)
   - Should clamp/validate friction_coefficient to [0, 1] for physical validity
3. Plan aligns with principles but needs documentation cleanup to maintain consistency
4. Recommendations:
   - Add step to update controller.h comments removing NET_FRACTION references
   - Add friction_coefficient validation/clamping in tuning_params::apply_to
   - Note: Ground vs air acceleration feel may change (intentional - ground now has friction opposition)

**Impact on implementation:**
- Added Step 4: Update controller.h documentation (remove stale NET_FRACTION references)
- Modified Step 1: Include note about parameter validation/clamping to [0, 1]
- Modified Step 2: Ensure gravity_mag calculation preserved for jump_velocity
- Kept Step 3: Confirmed controller.cpp friction application already correct
- Note: Ground acceleration feel change is intentional (physics correctness over preserving non-physical feel)

- Range: [0.0, 1.0] (automatically clamped)
- 0.0 = no friction (ice)
- 0.7 = default (snappy, rubber-like)
- 1.0 = maximum friction
