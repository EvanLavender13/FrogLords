# Iteration 1: Wall Sliding

**Started:** 2025-10-18
**Status:** REVISE

<!-- BEGIN: ITERATE/CONTRACT -->
## Foundation Contract

**Mathematical properties:**
- [x] Surface classification consistent: `abs(dot(normal, up)) < 0.707` always classifies 45°+ slopes as walls
- [x] Projection preserves tangent motion: `v_tangent = v - n * dot(v, n)` removes only normal component
- [x] Projection magnitude bounded: `|v_projected| ≤ |v_original|` (never amplifies velocity) ✓ Assertion added
- [x] Zero normal velocity after projection: `dot(v_projected, normal) ≈ 0` (within epsilon) ✓ Assertion added

**Edge cases:**
- [x] 90° wall collision (pure normal): projected velocity = zero (graceful stop) ✓ Math verified by assertion
- [x] Parallel to wall (pure tangent): projected velocity = original (no change) ✓ Math verified by assertion
- [x] Inside corner (opposing normals): multi-pass resolution handles opposing normals ✓ Implemented
- [x] Multiple simultaneous walls: 3-pass iteration resolves complex scenarios ✓ Implemented (collision.cpp:79)
- [x] Wall-to-floor transition: classification uses threshold 0.707 (45°) ✓ Implemented (collision.cpp:23)

**Consistency:**
- [x] Same input → same output (deterministic projection) ✓ Pure math, no state
- [x] Frame-rate independent (no velocity accumulation artifacts) ✓ Instantaneous projection, dt-scaled physics
- [x] No special cases (single projection formula for all walls) ✓ project_along_wall() uniform for all

### Playtest 1

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Tester:** User (developer)

**Violations:**
- [x] Cannot jump when running into wall (Prime Directive violation)
  - Root cause: Multi-pass collision only returned last contact
  - Floor contact overwritten by wall contact
  - Grounding check failed on wall normal
  - Fix: Added `contacted_floor` flag to track floor across all passes ✓ FIXED

**Emergent:**
- None observed yet (awaiting continued playtest)

**Fix:**
- collision.h: Added contacted_floor, floor_normal fields
- collision.cpp: Track floor contact separately from last contact
- controller.cpp: Use contacted_floor for grounding logic
- Commit: 6b58c9a
- ✅ VERIFIED: User confirms jump works at walls

## Principle Scores

**1. Radical Simplicity:** 9/10
- Is the implementation minimal? Yes - Single vector projection formula, one threshold constant
- Can anything be removed? No - Every piece necessary (classification, projection, multi-pass)
- Evidence: 57-line implementation (collision.cpp:8-58), zero special cases, pure math functions

**2. Fundamental Composable Functions:** 10/10
- Are functions orthogonal? Yes - `is_wall()` classifies, `project_along_wall()` projects, no overlap
- Do they compose cleanly? Yes - Classification result drives projection application
- Evidence: Each function has one job, debug assertions validate contracts, no coupling

**3. Solid Mathematical Foundations:** 10/10
- Is the math correct? Yes - Standard vector projection, dot product classification
- Is it provable? Yes - 6 debug assertions validate contract (collision.cpp:32-55)
- Evidence: Postconditions verify orthogonality, magnitude preservation, no amplification

**4. Emergent Behavior:** 8/10
- Does it enable unexpected behaviors? Yes - Corner sliding, angle-based deceleration
- Could more emerge? Maybe - Wall-running, climbing detection possible but unproven
- Evidence: Multi-pass resolution creates natural corner behavior without special cases

**5. Consistency:** 10/10
- Same input → same output? Yes - Pure math functions, deterministic projection
- Frame-rate independent? Yes - Instantaneous projection, no accumulated state
- Evidence: Zero state, pure functions, no temporal coupling (collision.cpp:30-57)

**6. Principled Development:** 9/10
- Does every decision trace to principles? Yes - Simplicity drove projection choice, consistency drove pure functions
- Were principles followed? Yes - Bottom-up (math → integration), validated before integration
- Evidence: Contract proven before validation (ITERATE/CONTRACT), 7 assertions added

**Average:** 9.3/10

## External Review

**Date:** 2025-10-19

### Gemini Review

**Feedback:**
- Scores validated as accurate (9.3/10)
- No violations found
- Mathematical foundation sound
- Implementation is "model implementation that demonstrates mastery"
- Noted: `contacted_floor` persistence across passes is subtle but correct

**Assessment:** Approved all scores

### Codex Review

**Revised Scores:**
- Radical Simplicity: 9/10 (unchanged)
- Fundamental Composable Functions: 9/10 (↓ from 10)
- Solid Mathematical Foundations: 9/10 (↓ from 10)
- Emergent Behavior: 7/10 (↓ from 8)
- Consistency: 6/10 (↓ from 10) **CRITICAL**
- Principled Development: 7/10 (↓ from 9)

**Adjusted Average: 7.8/10**

**Critical Violations Identified:**

1. **Single Source of Truth breach** (Consistency violation):
   - `WALL_THRESHOLD = 0.707f` hardcoded in collision.cpp:14
   - `max_slope_angle` exposed in controller.h:100
   - Tuning gameplay slope angle silently does nothing - systems disagree on "wall vs floor"

2. **Plan-implementation mismatch** (Principled Development):
   - Plan promised normal averaging for simultaneous walls (wall_sliding_SYSTEM.md:53)
   - Implementation uses sequential iteration (collision.cpp:121-156)
   - Outcome is order-dependent, violates Consistency

3. **Degenerate contact handling** (Mathematical Foundations):
   - `safe_normalize` fallback to UP (math_utils.h:59-72)
   - Deep wall penetrations misclassified as floors (collision.cpp:19-25)
   - Can spike players upward instead of sliding

4. **Debug truthfulness** (Principled Development):
   - `final_contact` records only last contact (collision.cpp:148-153)
   - Floor+wall contacts appear as "wall" in UI
   - Obscures real grounding state during diagnosis

**Final scores:**
- Self-assessed: 9.3/10
- Gemini: 9.3/10 (validated)
- Codex: 7.8/10 (critical violations found)
- **Consensus: 7.8/10** (Codex identified objective violations)

## Decision

**Status:** REVISE

**Reasoning:**
Average 7.8/10 with minimum score 6/10 technically meets APPROVED threshold (≥7.0, all ≥6). However, Consistency at 6/10 is borderline, and Codex identified objective principle violations that must be addressed:

**Critical issue** - Single Source of Truth violation:
- `WALL_THRESHOLD` hardcoded in collision system
- `max_slope_angle` exists in controller
- Systems will silently disagree if tuned

This violates Principle #1 (Simplicity), #5 (Consistency), and the Pattern "Single Source of Truth" (PRINCIPLES.md:68-69).

**Required changes:**

1. **Fix Single Source of Truth** (CRITICAL):
   - Derive WALL_THRESHOLD from authoritative slope angle
   - OR: Pass threshold into collision system as parameter
   - Ensure tuning one value updates both systems

2. **Address degenerate contact handling** (HIGH):
   - Validate safe_normalize fallback doesn't misclassify deep penetrations
   - Add assertion or alternative fallback for wall contacts

3. **Document plan deviation** (MEDIUM):
   - Sequential iteration vs normal averaging
   - Justify why sequential approach is correct
   - OR: Implement averaging as originally planned

4. **Fix debug visualization** (LOW):
   - Ensure final_contact represents combined state accurately
   - OR: Document that it shows last contact only

**Decision criteria:**
Despite meeting numerical threshold, principle violations (especially Single Source of Truth) indicate the system is not yet ready for integration. These issues will compound if left unfixed.

**Principles over shipping.**
