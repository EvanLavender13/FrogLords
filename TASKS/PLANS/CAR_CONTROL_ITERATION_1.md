<!-- BEGIN: ITERATE/CONTRACT -->
## Foundation Contract

Define what must be proven about this system. Choose categories that serve validation.

### Time Independence
- [x] Heading integration produces identical rotation regardless of frame rate (9a76418)
- [x] Turn rate scaling by dt prevents frame-dependent behavior (9a76418)
- [x] Angle wrapping maintains correctness across time steps (9a76418)

### Mathematical Correctness
- [x] Heading yaw stays within valid range [-π, π] after wrapping (9a76418)
- [x] Basis vectors (forward/right) are orthonormal when derived from heading (9a76418)
- [ ] Turn direction matches input sign (A increases yaw, D decreases yaw)

### Input Transformation
- [x] CAR_LIKE mode: lateral input (x) controls turn rate, not lateral acceleration (ad34cd5)
- [x] CAR_LIKE mode: forward input (y) drives motion along heading direction (ad34cd5)
- [x] FREE_STRAFE mode: existing camera-relative behavior unchanged (ad34cd5)

### Edge Cases
- [x] Zero turn rate input maintains stable heading (ad34cd5 - validated by finiteness assertions)
- [x] Maximum turn rate input produces stable rotation (ad34cd5 - validated by finiteness/wrapping assertions)
- [x] Rapid control scheme toggle preserves physics state (ad34cd5 - no state mutation, only basis selection)
- [x] Heading wraps correctly at ±π boundary (9a76418 - validated by wrapping postcondition)

### Playtest 1

**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Tester:** User

**Contract Validation:**
- ✓ Time-independent heading integration (no frame-rate dependencies observed)
- ✓ Heading wrapping at ±π boundary (smooth rotation, no discontinuities)
- ✓ Basis vectors orthonormal (no visual artifacts)
- ✓ Speed-dependent turning (can turn while coasting, turn rate scales with velocity)
- ✓ Input transformation (lateral input zeroed in CAR_LIKE mode)
- ✓ Control scheme toggle (immediate response, stable)

**Known Limitation (deferred):**
- Character visual orientation still velocity-driven (doesn't follow heading_yaw)
- This is expected - reactive systems work deferred to future iteration
- Input transformation primitive validated successfully

**Violations:** None

**Fix:** N/A - no violations found
