**Violation:** `spring_damper::update` (src/foundation/spring_damper.cpp:5) accepts invalid delta_time values without validation, violating Humble Validation principle.

Zero dt causes division by zero. Negative dt reverses time. NaN propagates through simulation. Silent failure cascades to vehicle tilt, dynamic FOV, and all future spring-damped systems.

**Complexity:** Simple fix - single assertion, isolated to one function. No behavior changes for valid inputs. Zero cascade risk.

**Approach:** Add debug assertion validating delta_time is positive and finite. Spring-damper is battle-tested Layer 2 primitive - validation maintains mathematical correctness guarantee with zero release overhead. Physical time must be positive and finite; assertion catches integration errors at violation point rather than downstream.

<!-- BEGIN: REFINE/COMPLETED -->
Added FL_PRECONDITION assertion to spring_damper::update validating delta_time > 0.0f and std::isfinite(delta_time). All unit tests pass. Manual verification confirms no regressions in vehicle tilt or dynamic FOV behavior. Principle upheld with zero runtime overhead in release builds.
