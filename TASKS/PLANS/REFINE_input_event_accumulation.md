# Refinement: Input Event Accumulation

Verify all input events accumulate rather than overwrite within a single frame.

## Selected

**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Complexity:** Trivial
**Path:** A (trivial)

<!-- BEGIN: SELECT/VIOLATION -->
## Violation

**Location:** `src/input/input.cpp` (keyboard, mouse button, touch handlers)
**Principle:** Consistency (Input is Intent)
**Severity:** Medium
**Type:** Potential input loss

**Current state:**
Mouse scroll accumulation was fixed (assignment → accumulation). Pattern suggests other input handlers may have same issue:
- Keyboard key presses
- Mouse button clicks
- Touch events

**Why violation:**
- Multiple events in a single frame could overwrite each other instead of accumulating
- Violates "Input is Intent" - player's input could be lost
- Inconsistent behavior: some handlers accumulate, others might overwrite
- Pattern discovered through retrospective analysis after mouse scroll fix

**Impact:**
- Blocks: None
- Cascades to: Player input responsiveness, control feel, principle adherence

<!-- BEGIN: SELECT/FIX -->
## Fix

**Approach:** Document

**DOCUMENT:**
- Why keep: This is an audit/verification task, not a fix (mouse scroll already fixed)
- Process:
  1. Read `src/input/input.cpp` completely
  2. Identify all event handlers (keyboard, mouse buttons, touch)
  3. Check each handler for assignment vs accumulation pattern
  4. Verify frame-clear logic resets state properly
  5. Document findings
- Trade-off: If all handlers already accumulate correctly, remove from backlog. If violations found, they become separate refinement tasks.

<!-- BEGIN: SELECT/SUCCESS -->
## Success

- [x] All input event handlers audited
- [x] Accumulation pattern verified or violations documented
- [x] No input events lost within single frame
- [x] Tests passing

**Metrics:**
- Handlers checked: 5 (keyboard down/up, mouse button down/up, mouse scroll, mouse position)
- Violations found: 0
- Documentation updated
<!-- END: SELECT/SUCCESS -->

<!-- BEGIN: REFINE/COMPLETED -->
## Completed

**Change:** Audited all input event handlers in `src/input/input.cpp`

**Findings:**
- Mouse scroll (line 75): Accumulation (`+=`) - CORRECT for delta values
- Keyboard events (lines 44-51): Assignment (`=`) - CORRECT for boolean state
- Mouse button events (lines 56-65): Assignment (`=`) - CORRECT for boolean state
- Mouse position (lines 70-71): Assignment (`=`) - CORRECT for absolute position

**Rationale:**
Boolean state (keyboard keys, mouse buttons) differs from delta values (scroll). Multiple DOWN events for same key within one frame are duplicates, not cumulative intent. Assignment of `true` multiple times produces identical result. Only delta values require accumulation.

**Tests:** All passing

**Result:** ✓ No violations found - pattern is correct as implemented

## Metrics

**Files:**
- `TASKS/PLANS/REFINE_input_event_accumulation.md`: 74 → 95 (+21 lines)

**Total:** +21 lines (documentation only, no code changes)

**Violations removed:**
- Suspected input accumulation violations: 0 (audit confirmed correct implementation)
<!-- END: MEASURE/METRICS -->

<!-- BEGIN: MEASURE/LEARNING -->
## Learning

**Root cause:** Retrospective analysis after mouse scroll fix incorrectly assumed similar pattern violations existed elsewhere.

**Prevention:** Distinguish between delta values (require accumulation) and boolean state (assignment is correct). Delta values like scroll accumulate intent; boolean events like key presses represent state, where multiple DOWN events are duplicates, not cumulative.

**Pattern:** Verification audits can reveal absence of violations—this is valuable learning that prevents unnecessary refactoring.
