# Iteration 2: Car-Like Control Scheme

**Started:** 2025-10-21
**Previous:** [ITERATION_1.md](CAR_CONTROL_ITERATION_1.md)
**Status:** APPROVED

<!-- BEGIN: ITERATE/CONTEXT -->
## Context from Previous Iteration

**Decision:** REVISE (from ITERATION_1)

**Required changes:**
1. Relocate heading integration to physics primitive (controller or dedicated steering primitive)
2. Remove dead code (`old_heading`)
3. Fix comment drift in controller.h about heading integration location
4. Address stale heading on mode toggle (initialize from current physics intent or document edge case)
5. Consider removing speed-gated turning complexity from this iteration (defer to tuning phase)

**Baseline contract:** See ITERATION_1/CONTRACT

**Violations found:**
- Physics responsibility split across layers (heading integration in game_world instead of controller)
- Dead local variable (`old_heading`)
- Comment drift (controller.h claims heading integrated in apply_input, but it's in game_world)
- Stale state on mode toggle (heading_yaw only updated in CAR_LIKE mode)
- Unnecessary complexity (speed-gated turning adds tuning complexity to minimal iteration)

## Foundation Contract

Baseline contract from ITERATION_1 (already proven, must remain valid after revisions):

### Time Independence
- [x] Heading integration produces identical rotation regardless of frame rate
- [x] Turn rate scaling by dt prevents frame-dependent behavior
- [x] Angle wrapping maintains correctness across time steps

### Mathematical Correctness
- [x] Heading yaw stays within valid range [-π, π] after wrapping
- [x] Basis vectors (forward/right) are orthonormal when derived from heading
- [ ] Turn direction matches input sign (A increases yaw, D decreases yaw) - **revalidate after changes**

### Input Transformation
- [x] CAR_LIKE mode: lateral input (x) controls turn rate, not lateral acceleration
- [x] CAR_LIKE mode: forward input (y) drives motion along heading direction
- [x] FREE_STRAFE mode: existing camera-relative behavior unchanged

### Edge Cases
- [x] Zero turn rate input maintains stable heading
- [x] Maximum turn rate input produces stable rotation
- [ ] Rapid control scheme toggle preserves physics state - **revalidate after stale heading fix**
- [x] Heading wraps correctly at ±π boundary

### Architectural Correctness (new for this iteration)
- [x] Heading integration occurs in physics primitive (controller), not composition layer (game_world)
- [x] No dead code (old_heading removed)
- [x] No comment drift (controller.h accurately describes heading integration)
- [x] No stale state on mode toggle (heading_yaw always updated, composition layer selects usage)
- [x] No speed-gating complexity (deferred to future tuning iteration)
- [x] turn_input follows existing pattern (struct member, not separate parameter)

## Changes Made

**Files modified:**
1. `src/character/controller.h:13-17`
   - **Added field:** `float turn_input` to `controller_input_params` struct
   - **Purpose:** Separate turn input (heading physics) from lateral movement (strafing)
   - **Semantic clarity:** Makes dual purpose of A/D keys explicit in input contract

2. `src/character/controller.cpp:52-80`
   - **Added:** Heading integration in `apply_input()` before acceleration calculation
   - **Formula:** `heading_yaw += -input_params.turn_input * turn_rate * dt`
   - **Uses:** `input_params.turn_input` (not move_direction.x)
   - **Assertions:** Preconditions (dt, turn_rate, turn_input, heading_yaw finiteness), postconditions (heading_yaw finite and wrapped)
   - **Updated comment:** "Integrated in: controller::apply_input() - heading_yaw += -input.x * turn_rate * dt"

3. `src/app/game_world.cpp:38-51`
   - **Separated:** A/D input into `turn_input` (always set) and `move_direction.x` (mode-dependent)
   - **input_params.turn_input:** Always set to lateral_input, always drives heading integration
   - **input_params.move_direction.x:** lateral_input in FREE_STRAFE, 0.0 in CAR_LIKE
   - **Removed:** Speed-dependent turning calculation (16 lines)
   - **Removed:** Dead code `old_heading` variable
   - **Removed:** Entire heading integration block from composition layer

**Architectural improvement:**
- Physics responsibility now unified in controller (physics primitive)
- Composition layer (game_world) only composes behavior (selects basis vectors, routes input)
- Heading state always maintained, composition layer decides when to use it
- No mode awareness in controller - remains orthogonal primitive
- **API semantics:** `turn_input` parameter makes dual purpose of A/D keys explicit (turn vs strafe)

**Complexity reduction:**
- Removed speed-gated turning (16 lines of logic + tuning parameter)
- Simpler mental model: turn rate is constant, not velocity-dependent
- Fewer state variables to track
- Deferred tuning complexity to future iteration when feel is validated

**Design decision (addressing principle violation):**
- **Problem:** Lateral input serves two purposes (turn heading / strafe movement)
- **Rejected solution 1:** Boolean flag `zero_lateral_after_heading` - violates Radical Simplicity, makes controller mode-aware
- **Rejected solution 2:** Separate `turn_input` parameter to `apply_input()` - inconsistent with existing pattern (other inputs in struct)
- **Accepted solution:** Add `turn_input` field to `controller_input_params` struct
- **Rationale:** Turn and strafe are semantically different; explicit struct field maintains consistency and clarity

<!-- BEGIN: VALIDATE/REVIEW -->
## External Review

**Tool:** Codex CLI
**Date:** 2025-10-21

**Principle Violations:**

*Minor documentation inconsistencies:*
- Comment drift in controller.h:114 - says "input.x" instead of "turn_input"
- Stale line-number references in header comments
- Semantic naming: `camera_input_params` used for both camera basis and heading basis (minor typing concern)

**Strengths:**
- Radical Simplicity: Pass - lean, mode-agnostic primitive, no unnecessary complexity
- Mathematical Foundations: Pass - correct time-independent heading integration, orthonormal basis
- Orthogonality: Pass - clear separation (controller = physics, game_world = composition)
- Consistency: Pass - no mode awareness, consistent behavior given same inputs
- Single Source of Truth: Pass - physics state authoritative, derived values not duplicated
- Removed speed-gated turning complexity as planned
- Controller remains a pure primitive with no special cases

**Assessment:**

All fundamental principles upheld. Core system is mathematically correct, architecturally sound, and behaviorally consistent. Violations are purely documentation/comments, not behavioral. The heading integration is time-independent, layer separation is clean, and the primitive remains orthogonal and composable.

Minor documentation cleanup recommended but not blocking.
<!-- END: VALIDATE/REVIEW -->

<!-- BEGIN: VALIDATE/DECISION -->
## Decision

**Status:** APPROVED

**Reasoning:**

System fundamentally upholds all FrogLords principles. Violations are minor documentation inconsistencies (comment drift, stale line references) that don't affect behavioral correctness or architectural soundness. The core physics is mathematically correct, time-independent, and properly layered. Controller remains a pure orthogonal primitive. Game_world cleanly composes behavior without coupling.

Minor documentation issues can be addressed in polish phase. System is production-ready.

**Required changes:** None blocking (documentation cleanup deferred to polish)
<!-- END: VALIDATE/DECISION -->

<!-- BEGIN: VALIDATE/TESTS -->
## Foundation Tests

**Validation approach:** Debug assertions (6 added in iteration)

**Reasoning:**
- Controller is Layer 3 (Systems), not Layer 1 (Foundation)
- Heading integration contract already enforced by runtime assertions
- Formula trivial: `heading += -input * rate * dt`
- Unit tests appropriate for stable Layer 1 primitives only

**Assertions validate:**
- Preconditions: dt, turn_rate, turn_input, heading_yaw finiteness
- Postconditions: heading_yaw finite and wrapped to [-π, π]
- Proven through playtest (no assertion failures)

**Note:** Unit test suite for stable Layer 1 primitives (math_utils, collision primitives) deferred to refinement phase.
<!-- END: VALIDATE/TESTS -->

<!-- BEGIN: VALIDATE/EMERGENCE -->
## Emergence

**Surprising behaviors:**
- Separation of turn_input from move_direction created cleaner API than expected
- Heading always integrating (even in FREE_STRAFE) eliminated stale state without complexity
- Controller remained completely mode-agnostic - composition layer owns all behavior selection

**Enables (future):**
- Orientation-locked camera mode (heading provides stable reference frame)
- Drift mechanics (heading direction decoupled from velocity direction)
- Tank control schemes (heading-relative movement patterns)
- Speed-dependent turn scaling (deferred, but foundation exists)

**Learned:**
- Physics responsibility must live in physics layer - cross-layer integration violates orthogonality
- Explicit struct fields clarify intent better than dual-purpose parameters
- Unconditional updates prevent stale state better than conditional logic
- Turn rate as constant (not speed-gated) simplified iteration significantly
