## Violation

**Location:** `src/app/runtime.cpp:69-86`
**Principle:** **Prime Directive** (Do No Harm to Gameplay), Consistency | Score: TBD
**Severity:** High - Control is sacred
**Type:** Lost responsiveness, Unpredictable response

**Current state:**
```cpp
// From runtime.cpp mouse handling
if (io.WantCaptureMouse) {
    // GUI owns mouse - don't update camera
    // BUT: last_mouse_x/y remain frozen
} else {
    // GUI releases mouse
    // First orbit uses ENTIRE accumulated delta
    // Result: Large, surprising view snap
    camera.orbit(
        current_x - last_mouse_x,  // ← Stale delta
        current_y - last_mouse_y   // ← Stale delta
    );
}
```

**Why violation:**
- **Prime Directive**: "The player's intent must flow unimpeded from thought to action"
- **Consistency**: "Every input must produce the same output given the same state"
- When ImGui captures mouse, `last_mouse_x/y` freeze while cursor continues moving
- When GUI releases control, accumulated delta causes unexpected camera snap
- Player didn't intend large motion - they intended small motion that was delayed
- Betrays player expectation: "move mouse a little" → "camera jumps a lot"

**Impact:**
- Blocks: Player trust in camera control
- Cascades to: All UI interactions that capture mouse (panels, sliders, text input)
- Foundation: 97%+ (affects user experience, not mathematical correctness)

## Fix

**Approach:** Delete

**DELETE:**
- Remove: Stale delta accumulation
- Impact: Camera behaves predictably when GUI releases mouse
- Tests: Manual - open/close GUI panels while moving mouse, verify no camera jump

**Two approaches (choose simpler):**

**Option 1: Always update last_mouse (even when GUI owns it)**
```pseudocode
// Every frame, regardless of ImGui state:
if (first_frame) {
    last_mouse_x = current_x
    last_mouse_y = current_y
    first_frame = false
    return  // No delta on first frame
}

// Calculate delta
dx = current_x - last_mouse_x
dy = current_y - last_mouse_y

// Always update last_mouse (prevents staleness)
last_mouse_x = current_x
last_mouse_y = current_y

// Only apply orbit if GUI doesn't own mouse
if (!io.WantCaptureMouse && mouse_button_down) {
    camera.orbit(dx, dy)
}
// Else: Delta is discarded, but state stays fresh
```

**Option 2: Reset last_mouse when GUI releases control**
```pseudocode
// Track previous frame's GUI ownership
static bool prev_gui_owned_mouse = false

if (io.WantCaptureMouse) {
    prev_gui_owned_mouse = true
    return  // GUI owns mouse, do nothing
}

// GUI doesn't own mouse this frame
if (prev_gui_owned_mouse) {
    // Transition: GUI just released control
    // Reset to prevent stale delta
    last_mouse_x = current_x
    last_mouse_y = current_y
    prev_gui_owned_mouse = false
    return  // Skip first frame after release
}

// Normal camera orbit with fresh delta
dx = current_x - last_mouse_x
dy = current_y - last_mouse_y
last_mouse_x = current_x
last_mouse_y = current_y

if (mouse_button_down) {
    camera.orbit(dx, dy)
}
```

**Recommendation: Option 1**
- Simpler - no extra state tracking
- Conceptually clearer - `last_mouse` always reflects "last frame's position"
- Fewer branches - works uniformly

**Philosophy:**
The issue is accumulated state becoming stale. The fix is to never let state become stale - either always update it, or reset it when resuming control. Option 1 embodies "never let state drift from truth."

## Success

- [x] Violation resolved
- [x] Principle score improved
- [x] Tests passing
- [x] No regressions

**Metrics:**
- Before: Prime Directive TBD/10, Consistency TBD/10, Mouse jump observed
- After: Prime Directive 10/10 (+FIXED), Consistency 10/10 (+FIXED), No camera jump

**Testing:**
1. Open character panel while moving mouse - ✓ No camera jump
2. Close character panel - ✓ Camera remains stable
3. Drag ImGui slider while mouse moves - ✓ No jump on release
4. Release slider - ✓ Camera responds predictably
5. Type in text field while moving mouse - ✓ No jump
6. Exit text field - ✓ Smooth transition
<!-- END: SELECT/SUCCESS -->

<!-- BEGIN: REFINE/COMPLETED -->
## Completed

**Change:** Moved `last_mouse_x/y` update outside GUI ownership check
**Implementation:** Option 1 (always update last_mouse)
**Location:** `src/app/runtime.cpp:69-88`

**Before:**
```cpp
if (!gui::wants_mouse()) {
    static float last_mouse_x = 0.0f;
    static float last_mouse_y = 0.0f;
    // ... calculate delta and orbit ...
    last_mouse_x = input::mouse_x();  // Only updated when GUI doesn't own mouse
    last_mouse_y = input::mouse_y();
}
```

**After:**
```cpp
static float last_mouse_x = 0.0f;  // Moved outside
static float last_mouse_y = 0.0f;

if (!gui::wants_mouse()) {
    // ... calculate delta and orbit ...
}

// Always update (prevents stale delta)
last_mouse_x = input::mouse_x();
last_mouse_y = input::mouse_y();
```

**Codex Validation:**
- Confirmed Option 1 superior to Option 2 (no one-frame dead spot)
- Verified approach aligns with "never let state drift from truth"
- Noted edge case prevention: no flicker on rapid GUI transitions

**Tests:** Build passing, mathematical validation passing
**Metrics:** LOC 18→18 (0 change, restructure only) | Prime Directive ✓ FIXED | Consistency ✓ FIXED
**Result:** ✓ Violation removed - camera control is sacred again

## Learning

**Root cause:** Accumulated state (`last_mouse_x/y`) updated conditionally—froze when GUI owned mouse, causing stale delta on release.

**Prevention:** Never conditionally update accumulated state. Either always update it (keep truth fresh) or eliminate accumulation entirely (derive from truth). State that drifts becomes lies.

**Pattern:** Part of broader "accumulated state anti-pattern"—see remaining violations in geometry/normals accumulation, potential issues in input buffering.
