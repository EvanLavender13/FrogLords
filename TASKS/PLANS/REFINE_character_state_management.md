**Date:** 2025-10-18

**Path:** B (Standard)

## Violation

**Location:** `src/gui/character_panel.cpp:17-21`
**Principle:** Consistency | Score: 7/10
**Severity:** High
**Type:** Multiple Truth Sources, Bidirectional Data Flow

**Current state:**
```cpp
// character_panel.cpp - GUI modifies controller directly AND params
bool changed = false;
changed |= gui::widget::slider_float("Max Speed (m/s)", &character.max_speed, 1.0f, 15.0f);
changed |= gui::widget::slider_float("Time to Max Speed (s)", &params.time_to_max_speed,
                                     0.1f, 2.0f);
changed |= gui::widget::slider_float("Jump Height (m)", &params.jump_height, 0.5f, 3.0f);
changed |= gui::widget::slider_float("Gravity (m/s^2)", &character.gravity, -20.0f, -5.0f);
```

```cpp
// tuning.h - Bidirectional flow
struct tuning_params {
    float time_to_max_speed = 0.4f;
    float jump_height = 1.3f;

    void apply_to(controller& c) const;     // params → controller
    void read_from(const controller& c);    // controller → params
};
```

**Why violation:**
- GUI modifies both `controller` directly (`max_speed`, `gravity`) AND `tuning_params` (`time_to_max_speed`, `jump_height`)
- Creates two paths for state changes - violates single source of truth
- Changing `max_speed` bypasses `apply_to()` recalculation → inconsistent derived values
- Bidirectional flow (`apply_to` + `read_from`) creates circular dependency
- No clear ownership: is controller or params the source of truth?

**Impact:**
- Blocks: Clean state management patterns
- Cascades to: Character controller, tuning system, GUI
- Foundation: Layer 3 (Systems) at 96%

## Fix

**Approach:** Simplify - Establish unidirectional data flow

**SIMPLIFY:**

**From:** Bidirectional flow with multiple truth sources
- GUI modifies controller fields directly
- GUI modifies tuning_params fields
- tuning_params has both `apply_to()` and `read_from()`
- Unclear which is source of truth

**To:** Unidirectional flow with single source of truth
- GUI modifies ONLY tuning_params fields
- tuning_params is single source of truth for high-level parameters
- After GUI changes, call `params.apply_to(controller)` to update derived values
- Remove `read_from()` - no longer needed

**Changes:**

1. **Add missing fields to tuning_params** (src/character/tuning.h):
   - Add `max_speed` field (currently only in controller)
   - Add `gravity` field (currently only in controller)
   - These become the authoritative high-level parameters

2. **Update apply_to()** (src/character/tuning.cpp):
   - Copy `max_speed` → `controller.max_speed`
   - Copy `gravity` → `controller.gravity`
   - Existing calculations already use `c.max_speed` and `c.gravity`

3. **Remove read_from()** (src/character/tuning.{h,cpp}):
   - Delete function entirely
   - Unidirectional flow - params flows TO controller only

4. **Update GUI** (src/gui/character_panel.cpp):
   - Change `&character.max_speed` → `&params.max_speed`
   - Change `&character.gravity` → `&params.gravity`
   - After any change: `if (changed) params.apply_to(character);`

5. **Update initialization** (wherever controller is created):
   - Create tuning_params with defaults
   - Call `params.apply_to(controller)` to initialize derived values

**Derive/Generalize:**
- `tuning_params` = high-level gameplay parameters (what designers tune)
- `controller` = low-level runtime state (what physics uses)
- Flow: Designer tunes params → `apply_to()` → Derived physics constants
- Pattern: Unidirectional transformation from intent to implementation

## Learning

**Root cause:**
The bidirectional flow emerged from incremental development without clear ownership design. Initially, `controller` held all parameters. When high-level tuning was needed, `tuning_params` was added with `apply_to()` to derive low-level physics constants. Later, `read_from()` was added to sync GUI changes back—creating a cycle. The system evolved without establishing which struct owned which concepts.

**Prevention:**
Before adding state synchronization between structs, ask:
1. Which struct represents *intent* (what designers specify)?
2. Which struct represents *implementation* (what runtime needs)?
3. Is the relationship transformation (intent → implementation) or bidirectional sync?

If transformation: One function, one direction. No sync needed.
If sync: Question whether both structs should exist—likely a design smell.

**Pattern recognition:**
This is the **Derived State Pattern**:
- High-level parameters (designer-friendly) → struct A
- Low-level runtime state (physics-friendly) → struct B
- One transformation function: `A::apply_to(B)`
- Flow: Designer edits A → `apply_to()` → B updates → Physics runs

Common in: Tuning systems, configuration → runtime state, gameplay params → simulation constants

**Remaining work:**
The remaining 2 GUI references to `&character.*` are legitimate:
- Character position/velocity (runtime state, not tuning)
- These should NOT flow through tuning_params

However, worth auditing all GUI panels for this pattern—do other systems have similar bidirectional flows?

**Key insight:**
When you find yourself writing both `apply_to()` and `read_from()`, stop. Ask: "Why do I need both?" The answer is usually "I don't—I need to pick a source of truth."

Unidirectional flow is not just cleaner—it's *simpler*. One function, one direction, one truth.

**The Designer-Friendly Parameters Pattern:**

This tuning class embodies a powerful pattern: **separation of designer intent from implementation complexity**.

**What makes parameters designer-friendly?**
- "Time to max speed" (400ms) vs "Ground acceleration" (80 m/s²)
- "Jump height" (1.3m) vs "Jump velocity" (5.0 m/s)
- Intuitive units that match how designers think about feel
- Parameters that directly map to gameplay experience

**The Facade for Physics:**
The tuning class acts as a facade—hiding physics complexity behind gameplay-relevant parameters:
- Designers tune: responsiveness, jump feel, gravity weight
- Physics receives: acceleration, friction coefficients, velocities
- The `apply_to()` transformation bridges these two worlds

**Combined with Debug GUI:**
The real power emerges when paired with visualization:
- GUI shows *adjustable* tuning parameters (designer-friendly)
- GUI displays *read-only* derived physics values (implementation details)
- Designers see both: what they control + what it produces
- Immediate feedback: adjust "time to max speed" → watch "ground_accel" change

**Example visualization:**
```
[Tuning Parameters - Adjustable]
Time to Max Speed: [====|====] 0.4s
Jump Height:        [=====|===] 1.3m

[Derived Physics - Read Only]
Ground Accel:  80.0 m/s²
Air Accel:     20.0 m/s²
Friction:      2.04 (dimensionless)
Jump Velocity: 5.04 m/s
```

**Why this matters:**
- **Accessibility**: Non-physics experts can tune feel without understanding spring-dampers
- **Correctness**: Physics calculations remain mathematically rigorous
- **Visibility**: Derived values visible prevents "magic number" syndrome
- **Iteration**: Designers iterate on feel, not implementation
- **Trust**: Seeing both sides builds understanding of the relationship

**The pattern generalizes:**
Wherever implementation is complex but intent is simple, insert a tuning facade:
- Animation timing (frames) → Spring constants
- Weapon feel (shots/sec) → Fire rate, recoil recovery
- Camera behavior (follow speed) → Damping, spring tension
- UI responsiveness (snappiness) → Interpolation curves

**Core principle:**
Design in the language of intent. Implement in the language of truth. Translate between them explicitly.

**CRITICAL: The Pattern Is Incomplete Without Validation**

The designer-friendly facade is **dangerous** without validation. Right now we have:
1. Designer says: "Jump height = 1.3m"
2. Physics calculates: `jump_velocity = sqrt(2 * gravity * height)`
3. Assumption: Jump height is actually 1.3m

**But is it?** How do we know?

**The missing piece: Mathematical validation through measurement**

The transformation from intent to implementation must be **provably correct**, not assumed correct:

```
Designer Intent → Math Transform → Physics Implementation → Measured Reality
     ↑                                                              ↓
     └──────────────────── Validation Loop ────────────────────────┘
```

**What validation means:**
- **Visual**: 3D trajectory plot showing actual jump arc with height markers
- **Measured**: Instrument the physics to record actual max height reached
- **Compared**: Does measured height match designer parameter? Show error.
- **Ground truth**: Define what "1 meter" means in world space (grid, reference object)

**Example validation display:**
```
[Tuning Parameters]
Jump Height: 1.3m (target)

[Derived Physics]
Jump Velocity: 5.04 m/s (calculated)
Gravity: -9.8 m/s²

[Measured Reality] ← NEW
Actual Jump Height: 1.297m
Error: -0.003m (-0.2%)
Status: ✓ Within tolerance

[Visualization]
  3.0m │
  2.0m │
  1.3m ├─────╮ ← Target height line
  1.0m │      ╲    ╱
  0.5m │       ╲  ╱
  0.0m └────────╲╱─────→ time
         Actual trajectory (measured)
```

**Why this matters:**
- **Trust but verify**: Math might be correct, but integration bugs exist
- **Frame rate effects**: Physics dt might introduce error
- **Accumulated drift**: Floating point, clamping, edge cases
- **World scale**: Is "1.0" in code actually 1 meter? Prove it.

**Without validation:**
- "1.3m" is just a label on a slider
- Designer has no idea if it's true
- Bugs hide behind "it looks about right"
- No way to detect drift or integration errors

**With validation:**
- "1.3m" is a **contract** between intent and reality
- System measures and reports compliance
- Errors are visible immediately
- Discrepancies force investigation of assumptions

**Implementation requirements:**
1. **World scale reference**: Place 1m cube in world, validate visual scale
2. **Instrumentation**: Physics reports actual outcomes (max height, time to ground, etc.)
3. **Visualization**: Plot trajectories with measurements overlaid
4. **Automated tests**: Assert measured values within tolerance of designer values
5. **GUI display**: Show both target and actual for all derived parameters

**The complete pattern:**
1. Designer-friendly parameters (intent)
2. Mathematical transformation (implementation)
3. **Measured validation (truth)**
4. Visual feedback (comprehension)

**Principle connection:**
This directly serves "Solid Mathematical Foundations":
> "Every behavior must be mathematically correct before it can be aesthetically pleasing. A beautiful lie is still a lie, and lies compound into chaos."

If jump height is 1.3m in the GUI but 1.1m in reality, that's a lie. The math might be correct, but the **claim** is false. Validation exposes lies.

**Next steps:**
- Add trajectory visualization with height/distance markers
- Instrument physics loop to measure actual jump apex
- Add world-space grid with 1m reference cubes
- Display measured vs. target values in GUI
- Write automated test: "Jump with 1.3m setting → measure apex → assert within 1cm"

**The pattern is not complete until reality confirms intent.**

## Risk

**Could go wrong:**
- Initialization order - controller might be used before `apply_to()` called
- Existing code might read from controller fields expecting them to be authoritative
- Tests might expect `read_from()` to exist

**Mitigation:**
- Search codebase for all controller initialization points
- Search for `read_from` usage
- Verify tests after changes
- Add assertion in controller that derived values are set (non-zero)

**Rollback:**
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD
# Or if committed:
git revert <commit-hash>
```

---

**One source of truth. Unidirectional flow. Simplicity wins.**
