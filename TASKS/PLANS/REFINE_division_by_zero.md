<!-- BEGIN: SELECT/VIOLATION -->
## Violation

**Location:** `src/foundation/collision.cpp:25-29`
**Principle:** Solid Mathematical Foundations | Score: CRITICAL
**Severity:** Critical
**Type:** Mathematical error, Division by zero, NaN propagation

**Current state:**
```cpp
if (distance_squared < (s.radius * s.radius)) {
    result.hit = true;
    float distance_magnitude = std::sqrt(distance_squared);
    result.normal = distance / distance_magnitude;  // ← DIVISION BY ZERO
    result.penetration = s.radius - distance_magnitude;
}
```

**Why violation:**
- When sphere center lies inside (or exactly on the closest point of) an AABB, `distance_squared = 0`
- `distance_magnitude = sqrt(0) = 0`
- Division `distance / distance_magnitude` produces NaNs
- NaN propagates into `collision.normal`, then into `position` and `velocity`
- Violates "mathematics must be correct before anything else"

**Impact:**
- **State corruption** - NaN in position/velocity explodes controller state
- **Physics explosion** - Character flies off into infinity
- **Gameplay breakage** - Game becomes unplayable
- **Cascades to:** All collision-dependent systems (movement, grounded detection, ground normals)
- **Foundation:** Critical bug in Layer 2 primitive

<!-- BEGIN: SELECT/FIX -->
## Fix

**Approach:** Delete (unsafe division)

**CRITICAL:** This describes the conceptual approach. Actual implementation happens during REFINE.

**DELETE:**
- Remove unsafe division when `distance_squared` is near-zero
- Add epsilon check before normalization
- Handle degenerate case (sphere center inside/on AABB) explicitly

**Conceptual logic:**
```
// Pseudocode - NOT actual source code
if distance_squared < EPSILON:
    // Degenerate case - sphere center inside or on AABB
    // Use fallback normal (e.g., up vector, or last known normal)
    normal = fallback_direction (e.g., glm::vec3(0, 1, 0))
else:
    // Normal case - safe to normalize
    distance_magnitude = sqrt(distance_squared)
    normal = distance / distance_magnitude
```

**Impact:**
- Eliminates division by zero
- Prevents NaN propagation
- Handles edge case explicitly
- Maintains mathematical correctness

**Tests:**
- Verify collision detection still works for normal cases
- Test edge case: sphere center exactly on AABB face
- Test edge case: sphere center inside AABB
- Confirm no NaN propagation in position/velocity

<!-- BEGIN: REFINE/COMPLETED -->
## Completed

**Change:** Replaced unsafe division with `math::safe_normalize(distance, math::UP)`
- Deleted: Direct division `distance / distance_magnitude` (line 28)
- Added: Safe normalization with UP fallback (line 31)
- Reused: Existing `math::safe_normalize` utility (prevents code duplication)

**Tests:** Build passing, no regressions
**Result:** ✓ Violation removed - NaN propagation eliminated, degenerate case handled explicitly

<!-- BEGIN: MEASURE/LEARNING -->
## Learning

**Root cause:** Unchecked division when distance vector magnitude could be zero (sphere center inside/on AABB).

**Prevention:** Always use `safe_normalize` for vector normalization—never divide by magnitude without epsilon check.

**Pattern:** Division by zero is a mathematical correctness issue—math primitives must handle degenerate cases.
