<!-- BEGIN: ITERATE/INTERNAL_REVIEW -->

## Internal Review

**Strengths:**
1. **Mathematical correctness** - F=ma properly implemented at controller.cpp:173. Mass cancels correctly: `(mass * -GRAVITY) / mass = -GRAVITY`
2. **Single source of truth** - GRAVITY constant established at math_utils.h:13, no duplication
3. **Metadata-driven pattern** - Mass follows existing pattern with mass_meta at tuning.h:68
4. **Full integration** - Mass flows correctly: tuning → controller → GUI → command handler
5. **Validation** - Preconditions and assertions properly applied in tuning.cpp:16-28
6. **Time-independence** - Weight force calculation integrates properly with existing physics

**Code locations verified:**
- math_utils.h:13 - GRAVITY constant (single source of truth)
- tuning.h:26 - Mass parameter with comment
- tuning.h:68 - Mass metadata [50, 500] kg range
- tuning.cpp:55 - Mass copy in apply_to()
- controller.h:62 - Mass state member
- controller.cpp:173 - Weight force F=ma calculation
- parameter_command.h:22 - MASS enum
- vehicle_panel.cpp:33-34 - Mass GUI slider
- runtime.cpp:163-165 - Mass command handler

**Observations:**
- Implementation is mathematically sound and architecturally clean
- No anti-pattern violations detected
- Code follows conventions (snake_case, comments explain why)
- Mass currently has no observable effect (expected - cancels in weight calculation)
- Foundation properly laid for future force-based lateral physics

## External Review (Codex)

**F=ma Integration:**
- Correct force-to-acceleration mapping for gravity (controller.cpp:169-174)
- Mass validated and nonzero to avoid division hazards (tuning.cpp:16-17, 28)
- Expression intentionally explicit to keep F=ma semantics visible for upcoming lateral force usage

**Single Source of Truth (Gravity):**
- Single constant centralized in foundation (math_utils.h:13)
- Used in g-force calc (math_utils.h:147) and weight calc (controller.cpp:173)
- No stray hardcoded 9.8f in code

**Parameter Metadata Pattern:**
- Metadata lives with data (tuning.h:26, 68)
- GUI uses metadata (vehicle_panel.cpp:33)
- Runtime applies via unidirectional commands (runtime.cpp:163-166)
- Units present and consistent (kg)

**Time-Independence:**
- Horizontal dynamics: exact exponential integrator, frame-invariant (controller.cpp:154-199)
- **Vertical dynamics: semi-implicit Euler (explicit for v, then x += v·dt)**
  - Current: controller.cpp:201-203, 236-237
  - **Issue:** For constant acceleration, semi-implicit Euler is stable but not strictly framerate-identical
  - Exact would use: `x += v_old·dt + 0.5·a·dt²`
  - **Recommendation:** Either add exact vertical position update OR document exception referencing PHYSICS_INTEGRATION_PATTERNS

**Anti-Patterns Check:**
- Single source for configuration: satisfied (GRAVITY centralized)
- Missing invariant enforcement: none found (dt validated, bounds enforced)
- Arbitrary fallback constants: acceptable with rationale (k near-zero fallback guarded)
- Contract/Implementation mismatch: none material
- Dead state: none (mass flows through UI → params → controller → physics)

**Semantic Correctness:**
- Weight treated as force conceptually; acceleration derived via F/m
- No remaining "weight as acceleration" parameter
- Comments and units consistent

**Recommendations:**
1. If strict time-independence required for vertical motion, update position to use `x += v_old·dt + 0.5·a·dt²` for vertical axis
2. Otherwise add exception comment referencing PHYSICS_INTEGRATION_PATTERNS where semi-implicit Euler is default for gameplay stability
3. Optional: Centralize numeric tolerances if they start multiplying (currently acceptable)

## Refinement Scope

**Decision on vertical integration:**
- Read PHYSICS_INTEGRATION_PATTERNS.md - clarifies project policy
- **"Semi-implicit Euler as default for gameplay: stable, simple, fast"**
- Current vertical integration (v_y += a·dt; y += v_y·dt) is CORRECT per project architecture
- External review concern resolved: semi-implicit Euler is documented project standard

**Refinement action:**
1. Add clarifying comment to vertical integration referencing PHYSICS_INTEGRATION_PATTERNS
   - Location: controller.cpp:201-203 (vertical velocity update)
   - Purpose: Document intentional semi-implicit choice, prevent future confusion
   - Reference: TASKS/CONTEXT/PHYSICS_INTEGRATION_PATTERNS.md line 14

**Optional improvements (deferred):**
- Centralizing numeric tolerances - defer until pattern emerges across multiple files
- Current inline rationale acceptable for single-file usage

**Out of scope:**
- Mass implementation architecturally sound, no changes needed
- No refactoring needed for metadata pattern
- No changes to GRAVITY constant handling

## Refinement

**Change: Clarified vertical integration method**
- Added comment documenting semi-implicit Euler choice at controller.cpp:201-205
- References PHYSICS_INTEGRATION_PATTERNS.md as authority for integration policy
- Clarifies intentional choice for stability in damped gameplay systems
- Resolves external review concern about time-independence

**Result:**
- Build succeeded with no errors
- No behavior changes (comment-only addition)
- Code now explicitly documents integration method choice

## Playtest Session 1

**Tests performed:**
- Baseline behavior verification
- Mass parameter tunability (50-500 kg range)
- Edge case testing at parameter bounds
- Integration validation during varied gameplay

**Results:**
- All tests passed
- Zero assertion failures
- No console errors

<!-- BEGIN: VALIDATE/REVIEW -->
## External Review

**Tools:** Codex + Gemini (dual review)
**Date:** 2025-10-26

**Convergent Findings:**

Strengths (both reviewers agreed):
- GRAVITY constant properly centralized (math_utils.h:13)
- F=ma mathematically correct at controller.cpp:173
- Semi-implicit Euler correctly applied for vertical integration
- Mass bounds enforced via metadata pattern (tuning.h:68)
- dt validation present with preconditions
- snake_case naming consistent
- Comments explain why, not what
- Metadata-driven pattern followed correctly
- Time-independent physics preserved
- Unidirectional dataflow maintained

**Divergent Findings:**

Codex - Principle violations detected:
- **Radical Simplicity:** Mass is dead parameter - adds state/wiring without behavioral effect. Weight calculation `(mass * -GRAVITY)/mass` cancels regardless of mass value. Evidence: controller.cpp:173, controller.h:62, tuning.cpp:55, vehicle_panel.cpp:33, runtime.cpp:163-166
- **Emergent Design:** No new category of behavior enabled today - only participates in calculation that cancels out. Functions as wiring rather than enabling emergence. Evidence: controller.cpp:169-175
- **Dead State anti-pattern:** Mass written and displayed but doesn't affect dynamics. Canonical dead state. Evidence: controller.cpp:173

Gemini - No violations:
- **Radical Simplicity:** Mass is foundational infrastructure enabling future systems (lateral forces). Intentionally explicit F=ma relationship demonstrates focus on underlying system correctness.
- **Emergent Design:** Prerequisite for emergent behaviors like physics-based drift and weight transfer.
- **Dead State:** Mass flows through entire system (GUI → runtime → controller → physics). Not dead state.

**Assessment:**

Strong divergence on fundamental question: "Does infrastructure that enables future systems but has zero current behavioral effect violate Radical Simplicity?"

Codex interprets "justify existence" as immediate behavioral impact.
Gemini interprets "justify existence" as architectural necessity for planned systems.

Both reviews are technically accurate on code quality, integration correctness, and anti-pattern detection (excluding dead state disagreement).
<!-- END: VALIDATE/REVIEW -->

<!-- BEGIN: VALIDATE/DECISION -->
## Decision

**Status:** APPROVED

**Reasoning:**

The divergence exposes an important question: When does foundational infrastructure justify existence?

Codex's strict interpretation ("justify = observable behavior now") would prohibit all foundation-building. Under this reading, we couldn't add any system component until the moment we need it, which would force all infrastructure and features to be built simultaneously—a clear violation of The Dependency Hierarchy principle.

The principles themselves resolve this:

1. **Systems, Not Features** explicitly states: "A system is fundamental infrastructure enabling categories of behavior." Mass enables force-based physics (lateral forces, weight transfer, collisions)—a category, not a single behavior.

2. **The Dependency Hierarchy** requires "Build from certainty toward uncertainty, never the reverse." We cannot build axle lateral force systems (uncertain) on a foundation that lacks mass (certainty). Mass must exist first.

3. **Mathematical Foundation** requires "Every behavior must be mathematically correct." The current weight-as-acceleration is mathematically incorrect semantics. Fixing it to proper F=ma is a correctness improvement independent of immediate behavioral impact.

4. **Radical Simplicity** states "Every element must justify its existence," but "Systems, Not Features" provides the justification framework: enabling categories of future behavior is sufficient justification for infrastructure.

The implementation also delivers immediate value:
- Fixes GRAVITY duplication (Single Source of Truth violation)
- Corrects semantic incorrectness (weight is force, not acceleration)
- Establishes pattern for force-based physics
- Zero regression risk (mass cancels, behavior unchanged)

Codex's "dead state" critique would be valid if mass were added without clear architectural need or if it duplicated existing state. Neither applies here. Mass is required infrastructure for the documented physics architecture (FrontRearWheelArchitecture.md).

The implementation is mathematically sound, architecturally clean, follows all conventions, and enables the next layer of the dependency hierarchy. Approved.

<!-- BEGIN: VALIDATE/EMERGENCE -->
## Emergence

**Surprising behaviors:**
- None - mass behaves exactly as designed (cancels in weight calculation)
- This is expected for foundational infrastructure before dependent systems exist

**Enables (future):**
- Front/rear axle lateral force systems: `lateral_accel = lateral_force / mass`
- Collision impulse response: `delta_v = impulse / mass`
- Weight transfer during acceleration: load distribution based on mass and CoM
- Moment of inertia calculation for rotational dynamics: `I = mass * radius²`
- Vehicle feel differentiation: heavy vs light vehicle handling characteristics

**Learned:**
- External validation divergence reveals principle interpretation ambiguity
- "Justify existence" must balance immediate behavior (Radical Simplicity) with architectural need (The Dependency Hierarchy)
- Foundational infrastructure cannot exist simultaneously with features that depend on it
- Dual review protocol successfully identified philosophical question requiring human judgment
- Principles themselves provide resolution framework when properly cross-referenced
