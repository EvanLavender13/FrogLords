<!-- BEGIN: SELECT/VIOLATION -->
## Violation

**Location:** `src/rendering/debug_validation.cpp:9`
**Principle:** Radical Simplicity
**Severity:** Low
**Type:** Dead code - testing library fundamentals

**Current state:**
```
Function: debug_viz::validation::run_startup_checks()
Length: 150 lines
Purpose: Validates GLM library behavior (cross products, matrix operations, coordinate systems)
Called from: src/app/runtime.cpp:44
```

**Why violation:**
- Tests well-established third-party library behavior (GLM)
- From earlier development phase when questioning mathematical foundation
- Mathematical foundation now validated through unit tests and usage
- Zero value added - library behavior is guaranteed

**Impact:**
- Blocks: None
- Cascades to: None - isolated debug code
<!-- END: SELECT/VIOLATION -->

---

<!-- BEGIN: SELECT/FIX -->
## Fix

**Approach:** Delete

**DELETE:**
- Remove: `debug_viz::validation::run_startup_checks()` function definition
- Remove: Function call from `src/app/runtime.cpp`
- Remove: Header file `src/rendering/debug_validation.h`
- Remove: Implementation file `src/rendering/debug_validation.cpp`
- Impact: Reduces debug code overhead, removes 150+ lines testing library behavior
- Tests: Build verification only - no behavioral changes

**Keep:**
- `fl::verify_coordinate_frame()` - used by debug_helpers.h
- `fl::verify_transform_matrix()` - used by debug_helpers.h and debug_assert.h

<!-- BEGIN: REFINE/COMPLETED -->
## Completed

**Change:** Deleted GLM library validation code
**Files Modified:**
- Deleted: `src/rendering/debug_validation.cpp` (~150 lines)
- Deleted: `src/rendering/debug_validation.h` (42 lines)
- Modified: `src/app/runtime.cpp` (removed include and function call)
- Modified: `CMakeLists.txt` (removed source file entry)

**Tests:** Build verification - all passing
**Result:** ✓ Violation removed - testing third-party library fundamentals deleted

## Metrics

**Files:**
- `src/rendering/debug_validation.cpp`: 160 → 0 (-160 lines, deleted)
- `src/rendering/debug_validation.h`: 41 → 0 (-41 lines, deleted)
- `src/app/runtime.cpp`: 248 → 244 (-4 lines)
- `CMakeLists.txt`: 87 → 86 (-1 line)

**Total:** -206 lines

**Violations removed:**
- Third-party library validation tests: 6 test suites, 16 assertions → 0
- Startup validation function: 1 → 0
<!-- END: MEASURE/METRICS -->

<!-- BEGIN: MEASURE/LEARNING -->
## Learning

**Root cause:** Early development phase uncertainty about GLM library behavior led to validation code that tested library guarantees rather than application logic.

**Prevention:** Trust battle-tested third-party libraries - validate application behavior and invariants only, not library fundamentals.

**Pattern:** Validation code should assert contracts and invariants in application domain, never test established library mathematics.
