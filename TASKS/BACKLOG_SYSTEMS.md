## ðŸ”„ MIGRATION: Character â†’ Vehicle Systems

**Completed:**

**Slip Angle Calculation**
- Angle between velocity vector and vehicle heading

## Infrastructure & Tools

**Generic Parameter Inspector**
- Auto-generate UI from metadata for any struct with param_meta fields

## Selection Criteria

**Before building:**
1. Dependencies must exist (check DEPENDENCY_STACK.md)
2. Problem must be understood (not guessed)
3. Create `/SYSTEM/SELECT` plan before starting

**Don't build from uncertainty. Build from clarity.**
