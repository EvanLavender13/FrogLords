## ðŸ”„ MIGRATION: Character â†’ Vehicle Systems

**Special section for systematic transition from character to car mechanics.**

### Phase 1: Backup & Branch
**Status:** Not Started

1. **Archive Character Systems**
   - Create `archive/character/` directory
   - Copy these files before modification:
     - `src/character/controller.{h,cpp}` â†’ `archive/character/`
     - `src/character/character_reactive_systems.{h,cpp}` â†’ `archive/character/`
     - `src/character/tuning.{h,cpp}` â†’ `archive/character/`
     - `src/character/animation.{h,cpp}` â†’ `archive/character/`
     - `src/character/orientation.{h,cpp}` â†’ `archive/character/`
   - Git commit: "archive: backup character systems before vehicle migration"

### Phase 2: Core Repurposing
**Status:** Not Started

2. **Transform Movement System** (Incremental - Each Step Compiles/Runs)

   **2.1 Rename Files (Zero Logic Changes)**
   - Move `src/character/controller.{h,cpp}` â†’ `src/vehicle/vehicle_controller.{h,cpp}`
   - Update all `#include` statements in dependent files
   - Test: Build succeeds, game runs identically

   **2.2 Rename Core Type**
   - `struct controller` â†’ `struct vehicle_controller`
   - Update all references in game_world and consumers
   - Keep all member variables, all logic identical
   - Test: Build succeeds, game runs identically

   **2.3 Add Vehicle Parameters (Preparation)**
   - Add `float wheelbase = 2.5f;` // meters - distance between axles
   - Add `float max_steering_angle = 25.0f;` // degrees
   - Add `float grip_coefficient = 1.2f;` // lateral grip multiplier
   - Don't use them yet, just add the fields
   - Test: Build succeeds, game runs identically

   **2.4 Remove Jump Mechanics**
   - Delete `jump_velocity`, `coyote_window`, `jump_buffer_window` parameters
   - Delete `coyote_timer`, `jump_buffer_timer` state variables
   - Delete jump input handling in `apply_input()` (lines 54-126)
   - Delete `update_jump_timers()` function
   - Remove `jump_pressed` from `controller_input_params`
   - Test: Build succeeds, no jump input, movement still works

   **2.5 Transform Gravity to Weight/Downforce**
   - Rename `float gravity = -9.8f;` â†’ `float weight = 15000.0f;` // Newtons
   - Keep applying it the same way in update_physics (downward force)
   - Update comments to reflect "weight pulling down" instead of "gravity"
   - Test: Build succeeds, vertical physics unchanged

   **2.6 Remove Wall Slide Detection**
   - Remove `is_wall` field from `contact_debug_info`
   - Remove wall-specific logic in `update_collision()`
   - Keep basic collision resolution, just remove wall classification
   - Test: Build succeeds, collision still resolves

   **2.7 Replace locomotion_state with traction_state**
   - Add `enum class traction_state { GRIP, DRIFT, AIRBORNE };`
   - Add `traction_state traction = traction_state::GRIP;`
   - Delete `locomotion_speed_state`, `locomotion_state` struct, `locomotion` member
   - Delete `update_locomotion_state()` function
   - Delete distance_traveled, cycle tracking variables
   - Set `traction = is_grounded ? GRIP : AIRBORNE;` in update()
   - Test: Build succeeds, state tracks grounded/airborne

   **2.8 Add Speed-Dependent Steering**
   - In `apply_input()`, replace heading integration with:
   - Calculate `speed`, compute `steering_limit = max_steering_angle * (1.0f - (speed/max_speed) * 0.7f)`
   - Scale `turn_rate` by `(steering_limit / max_steering_angle)`
   - Test: Steering gets tighter at high speeds

   **2.9 Add Circle-Based Position Calculation (Major)**
   - In `update_physics()`, after velocity integration, before position integration
   - Calculate `turn_radius = wheelbase / tan(steering_angle)` with singularity guard
   - Calculate `omega = speed / turn_radius`
   - Calculate `circle_center = position + perpendicular(heading) * turn_radius`
   - Rotate position around circle center by `omega * dt`
   - Rotate heading to match: `heading_yaw += angle_change`
   - Replaces standard `position += velocity * dt` for horizontal movement
   - Test: Car follows circular arcs when turning

   **2.10 Add Drift Detection (Lateral Acceleration)**
   - After circle calculation, compute `lateral_accel = speed * omega`
   - Compare to `max_lateral_accel = grip_coefficient * 9.8f`
   - If exceeded: set `traction = DRIFT`, reduce speed by `drift_speed_loss * dt`
   - Else: set `traction = GRIP`
   - Test: High-speed sharp turns trigger DRIFT state, speed bleeds

   **2.11 Separate Circle-Following from Drift**
   - Only apply perfect circle position when `traction == GRIP`
   - When `traction == DRIFT`: use standard `position += velocity * dt`
   - Test: GRIP = perfect arcs, DRIFT = looser sliding

   **2.12 Add Steering Metadata**
   - Add parameter metadata for GUI:
   - `max_steering_angle_meta`, `grip_coefficient_meta`
   - Test: Vehicle tuning panel shows new parameters

   **2.13 Remove Dead Code**
   - Delete `walk_threshold`, `run_threshold`, cycle_length variables
   - Delete `get_cycle_length()` function
   - Clean up unused includes
   - Test: Build succeeds, no warnings

     - `acceleration` â†’ `engine_torque` + `traction_coefficient`
     - `gravity` â†’ `downforce` + `weight`
     - `jump_velocity` â†’ `handbrake_force`
     - `turn_rate` â†’ `max_steering_angle`
   - Add new parameters:

    - Validate: Spring-damper still critically damped
    - Ensure: Parameter metadata generates correct UI

### Migration Rules

- **Never delete without archiving** - Character systems may have useful patterns
- **Incremental transformation** - One system at a time, test between changes
- **Preserve working foundation** - Don't touch Layer 1 (CORE) or stable Layer 2 primitives
- **Maintain principles** - Mathematical correctness, frame-rate independence
- **Git commit each phase** - Easy rollback if needed

### Success Criteria

âœ… Vehicle responds to WASD with forward/back + steering
âœ… Collision detection works with track boundaries
âœ… Debug visualization shows vehicle state clearly
âœ… Parameter tuning UI functions with new vehicle parameters
âœ… Spring-damper systems create smooth visual motion
âœ… No character-specific code remains in active systems
