# Retrospective: 2025-10-19

**5 plans analyzed. 5 patterns found.**

---

## Patterns (≥3 occurrences)

**Principle Violations:**
1. External review reveals blind spots (×5) - All plans benefited from Codex CLI, catching violations missed by self-review (phase continuity broken, output contracts violated, invariant enforcement gaps, enum naming violations)
2. Documentation/code divergence (×3) - walk_run ITERATION_1 (contract claimed "phase continues" - false), ITERATION_2 (stale cycle lengths in docs), semantic_types (SELECT/FIX contradicted REFINE/PLAN)

**Workflow Friction:**
1. External review timing matters (×5) - Pre-implementation reviews catch preconditions/invariants, post-implementation reviews catch contract violations. Both provide distinct value.

**Documentation Bloat:**
1. Excessive documentation for trivial changes (×2) - debug_viz_colors (175 lines / 4 LOC = 44:1 ratio), debug_draw_batching (194 lines / 41 LOC = 4.7:1 ratio). Simple deletions don't need full refinement plans.

**Deferred (<3 occurrences):**
1. Multi-iteration refinement cycles (×1 - walk_run only) - Revisit if more systems need 3+ iterations
2. Inference over explicit types (×2 - debug viz, semantic types) - Resolved by semantic types refinement

## Important Ideas from Plans

**Distance as Source of Truth Pattern** (walk_run_speed_states_ITERATION_3):
- Continuous primitive (distance) drives discontinuous outputs (phase, state)
- Multiple representations must derive from same source, never parallel state
- Phase as OUTPUT eliminates synchronization bugs
- Application: Any cyclic motion system (animation, audio timing, particle effects)
- Backlog: None needed - pattern documented in completed system

**Semantic Typing Principle** (debug_viz_colors → semantic_types):
- Never infer gameplay semantics from mathematical primitives
- Add explicit type information when geometry alone is insufficient
- Application: AI behavior, movement abilities, physics materials
- Backlog: None needed - semantic_types refinement completed

**Profile Before Optimizing** (debug_draw_batching):
- Debug paths stay simple until data proves complexity pays
- Premature optimization adds technical debt without evidence
- Application: All non-critical rendering paths
- Backlog: None needed - pattern demonstrated via deletion

## Actions

**Context Files (COMMON):**
- Create `TASKS/EXTERNAL_REVIEW.md` - Document when to use pre vs post Codex review, checklist of common blind spots (invariants, output contracts, stale docs, naming conventions)

**Workflow Updates (COMMON):**
- `TASKS/REFINE.md`: Add lightweight path for trivial changes (<10 LOC, pure deletion) - skip full plan, just fix + commit with learning note
- `TASKS/ITERATE.md`: Add step "Run external review BEFORE implementation if plan involves contracts, invariants, or math" (in addition to existing post-implementation review)
- `TASKS/SYSTEM.md`: Add reminder to update MATHEMATICAL_FOUNDATION section when values change (cycle lengths, thresholds, etc.)

**Backlog Updates (COMMON):**
- None needed - all important ideas either completed or documented in existing systems

**PRINCIPLES.md Updates (RARE - only if principle itself is wrong):**
- None needed - violations were in code/docs, not principles themselves

---

## Summary

- Patterns: 5 (4 actionable, 1 deferred)
- Important Ideas: 3 (all completed or documented)
- Actions: 1 context file, 3 workflow updates, 0 backlog, 0 PRINCIPLES updates
- Execute: Context file first, then workflow updates
- Is workflow working? **Yes** - 5/5 plans completed smoothly, iteration process elevated walk_run from 5.8 → 8.7

**Key insight:** External review catches violations invisible to self-review. Pre-implementation review prevents implementation errors (invariants, preconditions). Post-implementation review validates contracts and mathematical correctness. Use both.

**Bloat concern:** Trivial changes need lighter process. Full refinement plan for 4-line deletion violates Radical Simplicity in documentation.
