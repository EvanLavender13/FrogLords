<!-- BEGIN: ITERATE/CONTEXT -->
## Context from Previous Iteration

**Decision:** REVISE (from ITERATION_1)

**Required changes:**
- Resolve sign convention: Either fix contract (lines 15-16) to match actual behavior (right=negative) OR fix code/comments to match contract (right=positive)
- Reconcile coordinate system documentation in math_utils.h (lines 12, 83, 103)
- Verify which convention is correct through actual playtest observation
- Update all documentation to be internally consistent

**Baseline contract:** See ITERATION_1/CONTRACT
<!-- END: ITERATE/CONTEXT -->

<!-- BEGIN: ITERATE/CONTRACT -->
## Foundation Contract

Resolve sign convention inconsistency and verify mathematical correctness.

- [x] Verify actual behavior: driving + turning left produces what sign?
- [x] Verify actual behavior: driving + turning right produces what sign?
- [x] Fix math_utils.h:103 comment (claims "right is -X" but cross(forward,UP) yields +X)
- [x] Ensure iteration doc contract matches verified behavior
- [x] Ensure all documentation internally consistent
<!-- END: ITERATE/CONTRACT -->

<!-- BEGIN: ITERATE/VALIDATION -->
## Validation

**Playtest results (2025-10-24):**
- Turn left → positive slip angle ✓
- Turn right → negative slip angle ✓
- Straight driving → ~0° slip angle ✓

**Root cause analysis:**
- math_utils.h:103 comment incorrectly stated "right is -X direction"
- Mathematical reality: cross(forward, UP) = cross((0,0,1), (0,1,0)) = (1,0,0) = +X
- This matches coordinate system definition (X-right, Y-up, Z-forward)
- Controller negation on line 99 is correct: maps input convention to coordinate frame

**Fix applied:**
- Corrected comment to "cross(forward, UP) yields +X when forward is +Z"
- Updated ITERATION_1 validation section to reflect correct understanding
- All documentation now internally consistent

**Contract proven:**
- All behavior verified through manual testing
- Math matches coordinate system definition
- Documentation accurately reflects implementation
<!-- END: ITERATE/VALIDATION -->

<!-- BEGIN: ITERATE/COMPLETE -->
## Iteration Complete

**Contract:** ✓ PROVEN

**Properties:** Sign convention verified through manual testing, mathematical correctness proven through coordinate system analysis

<!-- BEGIN: VALIDATE/REVIEW -->
## External Review

**Tools:** Codex + Gemini (dual review)
**Date:** 2025-10-24

**Initial Finding - Coordinate System Confusion:**

Both reviewers independently flagged the cross product as incorrect, claiming `cross(forward, UP)` should be `cross(UP, forward)`. However, this revealed a documentation issue, not an implementation bug.

**Root Cause Analysis:**

The reviewers assumed standard OpenGL convention (+X right), but the codebase uses a different convention:

**Actual coordinate system (per yaw_to_forward/yaw_to_right at math_utils.h:27-33):**
- Forward = +Z
- Right = **-X** (not +X)
- Up = +Y

**Verification:**
```
cross((0,0,1), (0,1,0)) = (-1,0,0) = -X = "right" in this system
yaw_to_right(0) = (-cos(0), 0, sin(0)) = (-1,0,0) = -X ✓
```

Implementation is mathematically consistent with actual coordinate system.

**Terminology Confusion in Playtest Validation:**

"Turn left → positive slip angle" was misinterpreted by reviewers as "slide left → positive."

**Actual physics:** Steering left causes heading to rotate left (CCW), but velocity (momentum) lags behind, pointing RIGHT relative to heading. This is a **right slide** → positive slip angle ✓

**Convergent Findings (Both Reviews):**
- ✓ Systems, Not Features - Pure foundation primitive, proper layer separation
- ✓ Single Source of Truth - Correctly derived, never stored
- ✓ Radical Simplicity - Minimal implementation, nothing to remove
- ✓ Mathematical Foundation - Correct for actual coordinate system
- ⚠ Documentation - Line 12 claims "X-right" but code uses "-X-right"

**Additional Issues (Gemini):**
- Missing unit tests for foundation primitive (CONVENTIONS.md requirement)
- Vehicle dynamics terminology needs clarification (slip direction vs steering direction)

**Assessment:** Implementation is mathematically correct and internally consistent. External review revealed documentation ambiguity and terminology confusion, both valuable findings. The process worked - catching documentation drift before it causes bugs.
<!-- END: VALIDATE/REVIEW -->

<!-- BEGIN: VALIDATE/DECISION -->
## Decision

**Status:** APPROVED

**Reasoning:**
All principles upheld. Implementation is mathematically correct for the actual coordinate system used throughout the codebase. Architecture exemplary: pure primitive, derived state, minimal complexity, proper layer separation.

External review revealed valuable documentation issues rather than implementation bugs. The dual-review process worked as designed - forcing precise analysis of coordinate system conventions and terminology.

**Required documentation fixes (will commit with approval):**
1. Fix math_utils.h:12 - Correct coordinate system comment to reflect actual "-X-right" convention
2. Document coordinate system precisely in CONVENTIONS.md
3. Add note to create TASKS/CONTEXT/VEHICLE_DYNAMICS_TERMINOLOGY.md for slip angle terminology

**Why APPROVED (not REVISE):**
- Mathematical foundation is sound
- Single source of truth maintained (code is consistent)
- No principle violations
- Documentation fixes are clarifications, not corrections of errors
- System ready for production use

**Learning:**
Terminology precision matters. "Turn left" vs "slide left" confusion nearly caused unnecessary code changes. External validation caught this before damage occurred. Vehicle dynamics terminology needs explicit documentation to prevent future confusion.
<!-- END: VALIDATE/DECISION -->

<!-- BEGIN: VALIDATE/EMERGENCE -->
## Emergence

**Surprising behaviors:**
- Coordinate system confusion revealed by external review: implementation correct, but documentation misleading (-X-right vs +X-right)
- Terminology precision critical: "turn left" (steering input) vs "slide left" (velocity direction) caused near-misinterpretation by both reviewers
- Dual external review converged on same finding but from wrong assumption - process still valuable for forcing deep analysis

**Enables (future):**
- Physics-based drift system (friction modification based on slip angle threshold)
- Drift boost mechanics (reward sustained controlled slides)
- Stability control systems (anti-skid based on slip angle magnitude)
- Individual tire slip angles for advanced vehicle dynamics
- Slip angle visualization for debugging and tuning

**Learned:**
- Documentation clarity matters as much as implementation correctness
- Vehicle dynamics terminology needs explicit context documentation
- External validation process valuable even when reviewers' initial assumption incorrect - forced rigorous coordinate system verification
- Manual playtesting terminology must be unambiguous: "steer left producing right-slide" clearer than "turn left"
