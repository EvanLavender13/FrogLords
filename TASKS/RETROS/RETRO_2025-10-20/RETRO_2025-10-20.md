# Retrospective: 2025-10-20

**7 plans analyzed. 2 patterns found.**

---

## Patterns (≥3 occurrences)

**Principle Violations:**
1. Mathematical Foundations - Degenerate case handling (×3)
   - Camera basis NaN propagation (unguarded normalize)
   - Collision face normal fallback (arbitrary UP constant)
   - Friction frame-rate dependence (sequential update error)
   - Root: Missing epsilon validation before division/normalization/inversion
   - Already documented in ACCUMULATED_STATE.md:11

2. Consistency - Input integrity (×2)
   - Mouse scroll overwrite vs accumulation
   - Pattern: Direct assignment to delta instead of accumulation
   - Suggests audit needed for other input handlers

**Workflow Success:**
1. Second opinion validation (×7) - All plans used Codex CLI successfully
   - Caught mathematical errors before integration
   - Identified edge cases and design flaws
   - Workflow requires no changes - process working

**Deferred (<3 occurrences):**
1. Debug visualization issues (×1) - Trail effect position-based vs velocity-based stopping check

## Important Ideas from Plans

**Drift Movement Mechanic** (REFINE_FRICTION):
- Low acceleration creates racing-game drift as velocity vector lags orientation
- Physics/animation independence enables emergent drift behavior
- Future system: movement mode variations, environmental modifiers

**Input Event Accumulation Audit** (REFINE_mouse_scroll):
- Root cause: Direct assignment assumes single event per frame
- Prevention: Always accumulate input events
- Next: Check keyboard, mouse buttons for same pattern

**Sequential Update Frame-Rate Dependencies** (REFINE_FRICTION, DASH_ITERATION_2):
- Sequential add/subtract creates unaccounted dt² error terms
- Prevention: Derive combined update from differential equations
- Validates time-independence analytically before implementation

**Manual Testing Cannot Validate Math** (DASH_ITERATION_2):
- "Feels right at 60fps" ≠ proof of frame-rate independence
- Checkboxes marked "validated" created false confidence
- Required: Analytical derivation or cross-FPS automated tests

## Actions

**Context Files:**
- None (epsilon validation already in ACCUMULATED_STATE.md, frame-rate independence in PHYSICS_INTEGRATION_PATTERNS.md)

**Workflow Updates:**
- None (7/7 plans completed successfully with current process)

**Backlog Updates:**
- Add refinement: Input event accumulation audit (keyboard, mouse buttons, touch)
- Add system idea: Drift movement mechanics (environmental/ability-based)

**PRINCIPLES.md Updates:**
- None (technical patterns belong in context files)

## Summary

- Patterns: 2 principle violations, 1 workflow success
- Important Ideas: 4 extracted (2 backlog items created)
- Actions: 2 backlog additions, 0 context files, 0 workflow updates
- Execute: Update backlog with new refinement and system idea
- Work status: 4 refinements completed, 1 system deferred, 2 iterations rejected
- Workflow status: Process working - Codex validation caught all critical issues before bad code merged
