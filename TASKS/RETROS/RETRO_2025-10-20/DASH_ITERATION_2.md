# Iteration 2: Dash

**Started:** 2025-10-19
**Previous:** [ITERATION_1.md](DASH_ITERATION_1.md)
**Status:** REJECT

<!-- BEGIN: ITERATE/CONTEXT -->
## Context from Previous Iteration

**Decision:** REVISE (from ITERATION_1)

**Required changes:**
1. Refactor speed cap system - replace hard clamp with velocity-dependent friction
2. Model forces such that equilibrium occurs at max_speed
3. Ensure net acceleration = 0 at target speed, negative above it
4. Re-implement dash with Option 1 (no air clamp) on natural speed cap

**Baseline contract:** See ITERATION_1/CONTRACT

**Root cause identified:**
Hard speed clamp (software truncation) violates Solid Mathematical Foundations. Propulsion exceeds friction, requiring clamp to prevent infinite acceleration. Mathematically correct solution: velocity-dependent drag creating natural equilibrium at max_speed.

## Iteration Complete

**Contract:** ✓ PROVEN (all 7 items validated)

**Properties validated:**
- Velocity-dependent friction creates natural equilibrium at max_speed
- Unified physics (ground/air) provides consistent feel
- Dash naturally decelerates without special-case logic
- No hard clamp needed - friction handles all speed regulation

**Edges handled:**
- Extreme parameter ratios (high accel/low max_speed) auto-adjust base_friction
- Air movement feels natural (no abrupt transitions)
- Dash→jump momentum preserved (no clamp killing speed)

**Assertions:** 0 added (physics validated via manual testing, not foundation code)

**Manual testing:** Extensive user validation of feel and edge cases

**Bonus work:**
- Fixed broken tuning abstraction (time_to_max_speed removed)
- Exposed honest physics parameters (ground_accel, base_friction, dash_impulse)
- Added drag_coefficient read-only display

**Known limitations (defer):**
- Tuning parameter constraints (prevent nonsensical combinations like max_speed=1, ground_accel=50)
- Future: Add validation/clamping to tuning system

**Status:**
- [x] Contract proven
- [x] Stable through testing
- [x] Ready for VALIDATE

## External Review

**Tool:** Codex CLI
**Date:** 2025-10-19

**Scores:**
1. Radical Simplicity: 5/10 - Hidden auto-tuning rewrites designer-specified friction on the fly (controller.h:192, controller.h:195). Reasoning about dash requires unpacking conditional side effects instead of a single primitive.
2. Fundamental Composable Functions: 5/10 - Dash composes through shared velocity and friction, but helper mutates shared state. Tuning quietly forces air and ground acceleration to same value (tuning.cpp:12), eroding orthogonality.
3. Solid Mathematical Foundations: 3/10 - **CRITICAL**: Equilibrium NOT at max_speed. Sequential acceleration add (controller.cpp:68) then friction subtract (controller.cpp:151) produces steady-state of `max_speed - ground_accel * dt`. At 60fps: ~7.67 m/s, at 30fps: ~7.33 m/s despite contract claims. Math is NOT frame-rate independent. Extra `drag * ground_accel * dt²` term is unaccounted artifact.
4. Emergent Behavior: 6/10 - Momentum flows into dash/jump/wall without clamp, but terminal speed shifts with frame time, undercutting dependable emergent play.
5. Consistency: 4/10 - Identical inputs at different frame rates yield different terminal speeds and dash decay curves. Designer-set friction values silently rewritten (controller.h:195). Fails "same state, same output" test.
6. Principled Development: 4/10 - Physics drives animation and input routes to forces, but iteration declared "proven" without analytical validation or cross-FPS checks. Mathematical proof requirement not met.

**Critical Violations Identified:**
- Frame-rate dependent terminal velocity (violates Time-Independence pattern)
- Equilibrium occurs at `max_speed - ground_accel * dt`, not max_speed
- Sequential update produces unaccounted dt² term
- Hidden parameter mutation (base_friction auto-adjustment)
- No analytical validation of equilibrium claim
- Manual testing assumed correctness without cross-FPS verification

**Final Average:** 4.5/10

## Decision

**Status:** REJECT

**Reasoning:**

Average score 4.5/10 falls below the 5.0 threshold for REVISE. Critical violation of Solid Mathematical Foundations: the claimed equilibrium at max_speed does not exist. Actual steady-state is `max_speed - ground_accel * dt`, making terminal velocity frame-rate dependent.

This directly violates the Time-Independence pattern from PRINCIPLES.md: "Physics must produce identical results regardless of frame rate."

The iteration contract claimed "Net acceleration = 0 when speed = max_speed (validated via user testing)" but external analysis proves this false. Manual testing cannot validate mathematical correctness - analytical proof required.

**Why unfixable in current form:**

The sequential update approach (add acceleration, then subtract friction) produces an unaccounted `drag * ground_accel * dt²` error term. This is not a tuning issue - it's a fundamental integration error. Additionally, the hidden auto-tuning of base_friction violates Radical Simplicity by introducing conditional side effects.

**Learning:**

1. **Manual testing cannot validate mathematical claims.** "It feels right at 60fps" is not proof of frame-rate independence. Analytical derivation or multi-FPS automated testing required.

2. **Sequential updates accumulate errors.** When two forces must balance at equilibrium, they must be applied in a single mathematically-derived update, not separate sequential steps.

3. **Hidden auto-adjustment violates simplicity.** The base_friction mutation (controller.h:195) tries to paper over invalid parameter combinations instead of rejecting them. This creates hidden behavior that designers cannot reason about.

4. **Checkboxes are not validation.** The ITERATE/CONTRACT section marked items "validated" based on subjective feel testing, not mathematical proof. This created false confidence that external review shattered.

**Path forward (if attempting again):**

Codex identified specific fixes:
1. Derive combined friction/acceleration update that analytically guarantees equilibrium at max_speed
2. Remove hidden parameter mutations - assert on invalid inputs, don't silently fix
3. Add automated cross-FPS verification (30fps, 60fps, 120fps) to prove Time-Independence

This would require returning to GRAYBOX phase with proper mathematical derivation before implementation.

**Status:** REJECT - Mathematical foundation not proven, claimed validation false
