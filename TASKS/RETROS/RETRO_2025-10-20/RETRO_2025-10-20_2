# Retrospective: 2025-10-20

**5 plans analyzed. 2 patterns found. 1 workflow issue identified.**

---

## Patterns (≥3 occurrences)

**Principle Violations:**
1. Consistency violations (×4) - enum_naming, const_naming, input_scaling, input_event_accumulation
   - All were naming/convention violations caught by tooling
   - All were mechanical fixes with zero behavioral changes

**Workflow Friction:**
1. Documentation bloat (×5) - All plans violate "Radical Simplicity" in their own writing
   - input_event_accumulation: +21 lines documentation for 0 code changes
   - const_naming: 130 lines for 4 constant renames
   - enum_naming: 176 lines for mechanical rename
   - Plans include detailed code examples in FIX sections (violates "Directness Over Demonstration")
   - Success/Completed sections duplicate metrics
   - Excessive verbosity: explanation/work ratio is extreme for trivial tasks

**Deferred (<3 occurrences):**
- Radical Simplicity violations (×2) - insufficient sample size, diverse causes

---

## Important Ideas from Plans

**Controller state audit** (unused_controller_state):
- Audit all controller fields for unused/write-only state
- Backlog: Add systematic state audit refinement

**CI/pre-commit enforcement** (enum_naming):
- clang-tidy catches naming violations
- Consider pre-commit hook integration

**Input abstraction pattern** (input_scaling):
- Input layer passes raw values; systems own scaling/sensitivity
- Generalizes beyond camera to all input consumers

**Verification audit value** (input_event_accumulation):
- Audits revealing absence of violations provide valuable confirmation
- Prevents unnecessary refactoring based on assumptions

---

## Actions

**Context Files:**
None - no technical patterns requiring extraction

**Workflow Updates:**

TASKS/REFINE.md:
- Add guideline: "For trivial refinements (naming, deletion), keep plan under 100 lines"
- Remove code examples from FIX template - state approach directly
- Collapse Success/Completed sections - they duplicate metrics

**Backlog Updates:**
- Add refinement: "Controller state audit - find unused/write-only fields"
- Update priority: "Uninitialized Renderer Buffer Members" remains medium priority
- Add investigation: "Pre-commit hook for clang-tidy enforcement"

**PRINCIPLES.md Updates:**
None - principles are correct, documentation violated them

---

## Summary

- Patterns: 2 (consistency violations, documentation bloat)
- Important Ideas: 4 (state audit, CI enforcement, input abstraction, audit value)
- Actions: 1 workflow update (simplify plan templates), 3 backlog items
- Execute: Update TASKS/REFINE.md template, add backlog items
- Work status: 5/5 completed smoothly - workflow functionally successful
- Workflow status: Process caught all violations, but documentation overhead excessive for trivial tasks

**Key insight:** Workflow works but violates its own principles. Apply "Radical Simplicity" to documentation itself.
