# Retrospective: 2025-10-19

**5 plans analyzed. 4 patterns found. 1 critical meta-violation discovered.**

---

## Patterns (≥3 occurrences)

**Code Patterns:**

1. **Dead Code Discovery** (×3) - World Geometry, Character State, Embedded Tests
   - Pattern: Storage/functions exist but are never actually used
   - Detection: Grep for usages before assuming necessity
   - Prevention: "Never add storage without a clear reader"

2. **Bidirectional Flow Anti-Pattern** (×3) - World Geometry, Character State, Buffer Creation
   - Pattern: Dual storage, `apply_to()` + `read_from()`, create/destroy cycles
   - Fix: Establish single source of truth with unidirectional flow
   - Prevention: "When you need both directions, you don't—pick one"

3. **Branch-First Instead of Math-First** (×3) - Gradient Continuity, Buffer Creation, Character State
   - Pattern: If/else logic instead of continuous mathematical functions
   - Fix: Replace branching with interpolation/streaming patterns
   - Prevention: "Is this discrete or continuous? Code should match."

**Meta-Pattern:**

4. **Documentation Bloat** (×5) - ALL PLANS violate Radical Simplicity
   - Average doc:code ratio: **34.8:1** (229 LOC documenting -21 code lines)
   - Character State: 400 LOC for 4 lines changed = **100:1 ratio**
   - Repetition: Metrics stated 3-4 times, principle validation duplicated
   - Bloat: Learning essays (220 lines), philosophical expansions unrelated to refinement
   - **This retrospective workflow is creating the problem it's meant to solve**

## Important Ideas from Plans

**Designer-Friendly Parameters Pattern** (Character State):
- Separate designer intent (jump height) from implementation (jump velocity)
- Tuning facade: designers tune feel, physics receives math
- GUI shows adjustable params + read-only derived values
- Generalizes to: animation timing, weapon feel, camera behavior, UI responsiveness

**Validation Through Measurement** (Character State):
- Pattern incomplete without validation: Designer Intent → Math → Implementation → **Measured Reality**
- Requirements: instrumentation, visualization, automated tests, world-scale reference
- "1.3m" is a contract between intent and reality, not just a label
- Next steps: trajectory plots, measure actual outcomes, compare to targets

**Testing Infrastructure Decisions** (Embedded Tests):
- Need test runner script, discovery mechanism, framework evaluation
- Decision trigger: when test count reaches 3-5 files
- Workflow integration: when/where tests are added in dev cycle

**Duplication Audit** (World Geometry):
- Check: player_state, animation system, other world properties
- First verify both actually use it (one might be dead)
- Pure deletion often beats elaborate unification

---

## Actions

**Context Files (Technical Details):**
- Create `DEAD_CODE_DETECTION.md` - grep patterns, prevention checklist
- Create `UNIDIRECTIONAL_FLOW.md` - single source of truth pattern, examples
- Inject into CLAUDE.md: No (available via search when relevant)

**Workflow Updates (Critical - Fix Document Bloat):**

**TASKS/REFINE/SELECT.md:**
- Delete "Risk" section (boilerplate - obvious rollback is `git checkout`)

**TASKS/REFINE/REFINE.md:**
- Delete "Principle Validation" section (duplicate of metrics in Completed)

**TASKS/REFINE/MEASURE.md:**
- Limit "Learning" section to 10 lines max: root cause + prevention only
- Add explicit constraint against philosophical expansions

**Target:** <100 lines total per plan document

**All Workflow Tasks (CRITICAL - Enable Future Automation):**
- Add section identifiers when writing to plan documents
- Format: `<!-- BEGIN: TASK_NAME/SECTION_NAME -->` and `<!-- END: TASK_NAME/SECTION_NAME -->`
- Benefits: Automated updates, clear attribution, redundancy detection, future tooling
- Example: `<!-- BEGIN: SELECT/VIOLATION -->` ... `<!-- END: SELECT/VIOLATION -->`
- Apply to: All tasks that write/append to plan documents

**TASKS/REFINE/SELECT.md:**
- Add section identifiers around content it writes
- Otherwise no changes (working well)

**TASKS/SYSTEM/GRAYBOX.md:**
- No changes (not in use yet)

**TASKS/RETRO.md:**
- No changes (this workflow correctly identified its own bloat)

**Backlog Updates:**
- None needed (current violations already tracked)

**PRINCIPLES.md Updates:**
- None (principles are correct, implementation of documentation is wrong)

---

## Summary

**Patterns:** 4 code patterns, 1 meta-pattern
**Actions:** 2 context files, 2 critical workflow fixes
**Execute:** Add section identifiers + fix PLAN.md template, then create context files

**Is workflow working?**

Code refinement: **Yes** - 5/5 plans succeeded, foundation improved 95%→97%

Documentation: **No** - All plans violate Radical Simplicity through excessive verbosity

**The irony:** Workflow designed to enforce principles creates documents that violate them.

**Root cause:** PLAN.md template has too many sections, encourages repetition and essay-writing

**Fix:** Apply "Delete until only insight remains" to the template itself

---

**Delete sections. State facts once. Stop when done.**
