# Retrospective: 2025-10-18

**5 plans analyzed. 1 pattern found (≥3 occurrences).**

## Patterns (≥3 occurrences)

**Workflow Friction:**
1. **REFINE workflow success** (×5) - All plans followed workflow successfully across both paths
   - Path A (trivial): Tuning defaults, Accumulated state
   - Path B (standard): Orientation, Spring validation, Controller mixed concerns
   - Metrics collection thorough and consistent
   - Reflection sections extremely valuable
   - **Action:** None - workflow is working perfectly

**Deferred (<3 occurrences):**
1. Custom implementation instead of primitives (×2) - Revisit if appears again
2. Undocumented trade-offs (×2) - Addressed via context file
3. Spring-damper as default pattern (×2) - Emerging, monitor
4. PRINCIPLES.md exception docs (×2) - Handled via context file

## Actions

**Context Files (COMMON):**
- ✅ Created `PHYSICS.md` for physics integration patterns (includes accumulated state)
  - Inject into CLAUDE.md: No (reference when needed)

**Workflow Updates (COMMON):**
- ✅ Update RETRO.md: Added clarification that workflow success ≠ pattern to fix

**Backlog Updates (COMMON):**
- None - all violations <3 occurrences

**PRINCIPLES.md Updates (RARE):**
- None - principles are correct, technical details go in context files

## Summary

- Patterns: 1 (workflow success)
- Actions: 2 (context file + workflow clarification)
- Execute: ✅ Created PHYSICS.md, ✅ Updated RETRO.md
- Is workflow working? **YES** - 5/5 plans completed successfully, no friction

**Key finding:** REFINE process is solid. All complexity paths work. Metrics are thorough. Reflections are valuable. Foundation improved from 89% → 95% across 5 refinements.

**No changes needed to core workflow.** Actions complete.
