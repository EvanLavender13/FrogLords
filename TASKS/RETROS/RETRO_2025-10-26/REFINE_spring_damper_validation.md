**Violation:** `spring_damper::update` (src/foundation/spring_damper.cpp:5) accepts invalid delta_time values without validation, violating Humble Validation principle.

Zero dt causes division by zero. Negative dt reverses time. NaN propagates through simulation. Silent failure cascades to vehicle tilt, dynamic FOV, and all future spring-damped systems.

**Complexity:** Simple fix - single assertion, isolated to one function. No behavior changes for valid inputs. Zero cascade risk.

**Approach:** Add debug assertion validating delta_time is positive and finite. Spring-damper is battle-tested Layer 2 primitive - validation maintains mathematical correctness guarantee with zero release overhead. Physical time must be positive and finite; assertion catches integration errors at violation point rather than downstream.

<!-- BEGIN: REFINE/COMPLETED -->
Added FL_PRECONDITION assertion to spring_damper::update validating delta_time > 0.0f and std::isfinite(delta_time). All unit tests pass. Manual verification confirms no regressions in vehicle tilt or dynamic FOV behavior. Principle upheld with zero runtime overhead in release builds.

**Code Changes:**
- src/foundation/spring_damper.cpp: 29 → 33 lines (+4)
- Added 1 include, 1 precondition assertion (2 lines with formatting)
- Total commit: +59 insertions, -275 deletions (documentation simplified)

**Violation Fixed:**
- Foundation primitives with validation: 1/8 → 2/8 (spring_damper now validated)
- spring_damper::update contract enforcement: none → delta_time positive and finite
- Potential crash points eliminated: division by zero, time reversal, NaN propagation

<!-- BEGIN: MEASURE/LEARNING -->
**Root Cause:** Foundation primitive implemented without contract validation. Delta_time accepted as trusted input despite being critical to numerical integration correctness.

**Prevention:** All foundation functions accepting time, distance, or normalized vectors must validate preconditions with debug assertions at function entry. Pattern already exists in collision.cpp and math_utils.h—enforce consistently across foundation layer.

**Pattern Validated:** Missing Validation at Foundation (PATTERNS.md:109). Spring_damper exemplifies the pattern: widely-used primitive accepting unchecked inputs. One assertion protects all downstream consumers (vehicle tilt, dynamic FOV, future spring-damped systems).
