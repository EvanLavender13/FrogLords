# REFINE - Execute the Fix

**Delete. Simplify. Document. In that order.**

---

## Purpose

Execute planned refinementâ€”remove violation, restore principle, reduce complexity.

---

## Prerequisites

- [ ] `TASKS/PLANS/REFINE_<name>.md` exists
- [ ] Complexity classified (Trivial or Standard)
- [ ] Branch `refine/<name>` active
- [ ] All tests passing

---

## Path A - Trivial

**Extremely simple deletions:** Skip formal plan if documentation would substantially exceed code change. Fix, commit with learning note in commit message, skip MEASURE. Use judgment.

### 1. Execute

Delete code, simplify logic, or document justification.

**Constraints:**
- Fix violation only
- No features, no scope creep
- Minimal change

### 2. Validate

```bash
[test command]
```

All tests pass. If not: fix, revert, or update tests with justification.

**Manual verification:**

If changes affect runtime behavior:
1. List what user must verify
2. Ask user to run app and verify
3. Wait for confirmation

### 3. Document

In `TASKS/PLANS/REFINE_<name>.md`:

```markdown
<!-- BEGIN: REFINE/COMPLETED -->
## Completed

**Change:** [deleted/simplified/documented what]
**Tests:** All passing | Updated: [list]
**Result:** âœ“ Violation removed
<!-- END: REFINE/COMPLETED -->
```

### 4. Commit

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "refine: <name> - <what was removed/simplified>

Restored: <principle>
Tests: All passing

**â†’ Proceed to MEASURE**

---

## Path B - Standard

### 1. Plan Steps

In `TASKS/PLANS/REFINE_<name>.md`:

```markdown
<!-- BEGIN: REFINE/PLAN -->
## Refinement Plan

### Step 1: [Name]
**Changes:** `<file>:<line>` - [from] â†’ [to]
**Tests:** [which update]
**Validation:** Tests pass, no regressions

[Repeat for each step]

## Rollback
`git reset --hard HEAD` or [specific revert steps]
<!-- END: REFINE/PLAN -->
```

### 2. Validate Plan

**Get a second opinion before executing:**

Use Codex to validate the approach.

```bash
bash scripts/bash/codex.sh "@TASKS/PLANS/REFINE_<name>.md @PRINCIPLES.md @CONVENTIONS.md [your validation question]"
```

**IMPORTANT:** Use `run_in_background: true` in Bash tool call.

**WAIT for user confirmation that review is complete.** This takes several minutes. Do NOT monitor output. User will confirm when finished.

**Evaluate feedback:**
- Concerns raised? Revise plan
- Alternative suggested? Consider it
- Need clarification? Continue the conversation with `codex e resume --last`
- **Changes made?** Request at least 1 review of revised plan
- Validation confirms? Proceed
- **Process cycling?** Consider radical simplification instead

**Rule:** Certainty through convergence. When independent analyses agree, confidence increases.

**Document the review:**

In `TASKS/PLANS/REFINE_<name>.md`, add:

```markdown
<!-- BEGIN: REFINE/REVIEW -->
## Second Opinion Review

**Tool:** [Codex CLI | Gemini CLI | other]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

**Question asked:**
[What you asked for validation]

**Concerns evaluated:**
- [List key concerns you wanted validated]

**Feedback received:**
- [Key points from the review]
- [Recommendations or warnings]

**Impact on implementation:**
- [How feedback changed your approach]
- [What you kept vs modified]
<!-- END: REFINE/REVIEW -->
```

### 3. Execute Each Step

**Per step:**

A. Make change (one step only)
B. Run tests
C. Verify: passing, correct behavior, no regressions
D. **Manual verification** (if changes affect runtime behavior):
   - List what user must verify
   - Ask user to run app and verify
   - Wait for confirmation
E. Commit:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "refine: <name> step N - <what changed>

<specific change>
Tests: Passing

ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

```

F. Mark step complete in plan

### 4. Handle Blockers

**Blocked:** Document why, suggest alternative, commit findings, proceed to MEASURE

**Scope grew:** If >1 day, consider deferring to system build

**Breaking changes:** Document impact, update affected systems, expand tests

---

## Outputs

- [ ] Violation fixed
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No regressions
- [ ] Principle score improved
- [ ] Steps committed
- [ ] Documentation updated

---

## Exit Criteria

**â†’ MEASURE when:**
- Fix complete
- Tests passing
- Principle score improved

**Defer if:**
- Blocker discovered
- Scope exceeds 1 day
- Breaking changes unacceptable

---

## Next Step

**â†’ MEASURE** (calculate before/after metrics)

---

## Core Rules

**Delete first:** Code you don't have can't have bugs, needs no maintenance, violates no principles.

**Small commits:** One change, all tests pass, independently revertable.

**No scope creep:** Fix violation only. Not features, not optimization, not nearby refactoring.

**Tests guard truth:** Green before â†’ Green after = behavior preserved. Red after = fix or revert.

**Document learning:** Why violation appeared, how to prevent recurrence, patterns to watch.

---

**Delete first. Simplify second. Document last. Test always.**
