## The Mathematics of Uncertainty

Uncertainty multiplies through dependencies:

**Current cascade:**
- Layer 1 (Core): 90%
- Layer 2 (Primitives): 100% ✓
- Layer 3 (Systems): 93%
- **Overall:** 0.90 × 1.00 × 0.93 = **84% survival chance** (improved!)

**After repairs (target):**

## Layer 4: VARIATIONS

**Certainty:** <50%
**Status:** 🚫 Don't build - foundation not ready

### Waiting on Repairs

**These systems cannot be built confidently until Layer 3 reaches 95%:**

- **Walk/Run Speed States** (3-5 points)
- **Wall Detection & Sliding** (3-5 points)
- **Dash Mechanic** (3-5 points)
- **IK Systems** (8 points)

**Reason:** Building on 90% foundation = 79% survival. After repairs (95%) = 89% survival.

**Last Changed:** Liquid pool (no details yet)

## Layer 5: POLISH

**Certainty:** <50%
**Status:** 🚫 Liquid pool only

### Far Future

- Audio system
- UI/HUD

## Build Rules

### Can Build (Layer 2 Only)
- Foundation ≥98% at Layer 2
- All dependencies satisfied
- Core stable (Layer 1 ≥90%)
- **Current:** Can build new primitives if needed

### Should Repair (Current Priority)

## Cascade Impact

### Historical Cascade

**Start (before audit):** 95% × 95% × 95% = **86%**
**After audit discovery:** 95% × 90% × 90% = **77%** (reality check)
**After debug viz:** 98% × 90% × 90% = **79%**
**After magic docs:** 98% × 90% × 90% = **89%** (understanding improved)
**After tuning fix:** 90% × 98% × 92% = **81%** (layer 3 improved)
**After spring-damper:** 90% × 100% × 93% = **84%** ✓ (Layer 2 complete!)

### Target Cascade

**After all repairs:**
- Layer 1: 95%
- Layer 2: 100% ✓ (ACHIEVED!)
- Layer 3: 95%
- **Overall: 95% × 100% × 95% = 90%**

**With Layer 4 ready:**
- Add Layer 4 at 90%
- 0.90 × 0.90 = **81% for 4-layer stack** (better with perfect Layer 2!)

**This is why we strengthen foundation first.**

## Repair Priority

**From TASKS/BACKLOG_REFINEMENTS.md:**

1. ✅ ~~**Tuning defaults**~~ (COMPLETED 2025-10-17)
2. ✅ ~~**Spring-damper test**~~ (COMPLETED 2025-10-17)
3. **Dual-reference** (high, 2 pts) ← NEXT
4. **Accumulated state** (medium, 2-3 pts)
5. **Mixed concerns** (medium, 3 pts)

**Progress:** 89% → 91% (+2%)
**Remaining:** ~3 more refinements to reach 95%

---

## Notes

**Patterns observed:**
- Debug visualization is force multiplier (discovered 2025-10-17)
- Documentation increases certainty dramatically (+10%)
- **Testing transforms documentation into proof (+2%, achieves 100%)**
- Special cases always indicate design problems
- Repairs aren't failures—they're discovered knowledge
- **Additive refinements (tests) are zero-risk, high-value**

**Dependencies discovered:**
- All animation work needs debug viz (now available ✓)
- Tuning blocks confident parameter work (fix next)
- Accumulated state acceptable if documented
- Dual-reference appears in multiple places (shared pattern)

**Cascade failures:**
- None yet (repairs caught before cascade)

**Unexpected solidifications:**
- Debug viz exceeded expectations (100% vs 90% estimate)
- Documentation provided +10% certainty boost
- **Testing achieved perfect Layer 2 (100%)**
- F3 toggle pattern reusable across all debug systems
- **Test template now reusable for all mathematical primitives**

## Usage

### After System Completion
1. Update certainty for that layer
2. Calculate cascade (multiply through dependent layers)
3. Move enabled systems in TASKS/BACKLOG_SYSTEMS.md
4. Document emergence in EMERGENCE.md

### After Refinement
1. Recalculate certainty (usually increases)
2. Note which principle restored
3. Update foundation state
4. Track metrics (LOC removed, etc.)

### Before System Selection
1. Check current layer certainties
2. Verify dependencies ≥90%
3. Confirm core remains solid
4. Select from appropriate layer
