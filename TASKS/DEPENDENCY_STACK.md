## Current State

```
Layer 5: POLISH          [<50%] ← liquid backlog only
    ↓
Layer 4: VARIATION       [<50%] ← waiting on repairs
    ↓
Layer 3: SYSTEMS         [90%] ← repair mode (89% → 95% target)
    ↓
Layer 2: PRIMITIVES      [98%] ← solid, proven
    ↓
Layer 1: CORE            [90%] ← working, known issues
```

**Overall Foundation Certainty:** 89%

**Status:** 🔧 **REPAIR MODE** - Strengthen foundation before expansion

## The Mathematics of Uncertainty

Uncertainty multiplies through dependencies:

**Current cascade:**
- Layer 1 (Core): 90%
- Layer 2 (Primitives): 98%
- Layer 3 (Systems): 90%
- **Overall:** 0.90 × 0.98 × 0.90 = **79% survival chance**

**After repairs (target):**
- Layer 1: 95%
- Layer 2: 98%
- Layer 3: 95%
- **Overall:** 0.95 × 0.98 × 0.95 = **89% survival chance**

**Build from bottom up. Never skip layers.**

- Reason: Too complex, prescriptive not emergent
- Learning: Simpler physics-based approach better
- If retry: Build from springs, not state machine

---

### Refinements Completed

**See BACKLOG_REFINEMENTS.md for detailed metrics**

Recent refinements improved foundation 77% → 89%:
1. Debug visualization (+3%)
2. Magic number documentation (+10%)
3. Remove special cases (+small)
4. Fix frame-rate issues (+small)

## Cascade Impact

### Historical Cascade

**Start (before audit):** 95% × 95% × 95% = **86%**
**After audit discovery:** 95% × 90% × 90% = **77%** (reality check)
**After debug viz:** 98% × 90% × 90% = **79%**
**After magic docs:** 98% × 90% × 90% = **89%** (understanding improved)

### Target Cascade

**After all repairs:**
- Layer 1: 95%
- Layer 2: 98%
- Layer 3: 95%
- **Overall: 95% × 98% × 95% = 89%**

**With Layer 4 ready:**
- Add Layer 4 at 90%
- 0.89 × 0.90 = **80% for 4-layer stack**

**This is why we strengthen foundation first.**

---

## Repair Priority

**From BACKLOG_REFINEMENTS.md:**

1. **Tuning defaults** (critical, 1 pt) ← IMMEDIATE
2. **Spring-damper test** (high, 1 pt)
3. **Dual-reference** (high, 2 pts)
4. **Accumulated state** (medium, 2-3 pts)
5. **Mixed concerns** (medium, 3 pts)

**After repairs:** Foundation → 95%, can confidently build Layer 4

---

## Notes

**Patterns observed:**
- Debug visualization is force multiplier (discovered 2025-10-17)
- Documentation increases certainty dramatically (+10%)
- Special cases always indicate design problems
- Repairs aren't failures—they're discovered knowledge

**Dependencies discovered:**
- All animation work needs debug viz (now available ✓)
- Tuning blocks confident parameter work (fix next)
- Accumulated state acceptable if documented
- Dual-reference appears in multiple places (shared pattern)

**Cascade failures:**
- None yet (repairs caught before cascade)

**Unexpected solidifications:**
- Debug viz exceeded expectations (98% vs 90% estimate)
- Documentation provided +10% certainty boost
- F3 toggle pattern reusable across all debug systems

## Usage

### After System Completion
1. Update certainty for that layer
2. Calculate cascade (multiply through dependent layers)
3. Move enabled systems in BACKLOG_SYSTEMS.md
4. Document emergence in EMERGENCE.md

### After Refinement
1. Recalculate certainty (usually increases)
2. Note which principle restored
3. Update foundation state
4. Track metrics (LOC removed, etc.)

### Before System Selection
1. Check current layer certainties
2. Verify dependencies ≥90%
3. Confirm core remains solid
4. Select from appropriate layer
