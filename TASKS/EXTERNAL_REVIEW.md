# External Review: When and How

**External review catches blind spots invisible to self-review.**

---

## When to Use

**Pre-Implementation:** After plan drafted, before implementation starts
- Reviews plans for design flaws
- Prevents implementation errors

**Post-Implementation:** After ITERATE completes, before marking APPROVED
- Reviews implementation against principles
- Validates contracts and completeness

**Both reviews provide distinct value. Don't skip either.**

## Tool

**Codex CLI:** `bash scripts/bash/codex.sh "@path/to/file Your question"`

Ask what you need to know. The tool will find what you missed.

## Discovered Blind Spots

See `TASKS/PATTERNS.md` for violations found across retrospectives.

Patterns emerge from completed work, not hypothetical checklists.
