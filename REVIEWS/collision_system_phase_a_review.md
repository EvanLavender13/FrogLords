# Review: Collision System Phase A Implementation

**Date:** October 5, 2025
**Subject:** Principle check on the initial implementation of sphere-vs-AABB collision as per `collision_system_implementation.md`.

**Status:** REVISED with playtest justifications

---

## 1. Behavior Implementation Analysis

The implementation of Phase A achieves the high-level goal: the character can stand on platforms. However, it deviates significantly from the behavior specified in the implementation plan.

**Plan:**
- **Weightlifter Sphere:** Responsible for all grounding and step-up logic.
- **Bumper Sphere:** Responsible for sliding and bouncing off walls/obstacles.

**Actual Implementation:**
- **Bumper Sphere:** Handles grounding on **flat** surfaces (`normal.y > 0.9f`).
- **Weightlifter Sphere:** Handles grounding on **sloped** surfaces (`0.5f < normal.y <= 0.9f`).
- **Bumper Sphere:** Also handles wall collisions (`normal.y <= 0.5f`).

This implementation does not follow the "lifter-first" grounding approach from the plan. While the character does collide with boxes, the fundamental behavior and responsibilities of the two spheres have been altered.

**PLAYTEST JUSTIFICATION (undocumented):**
The original "lifter-first" approach caused the character to feel unstable on flat platforms. With the lifter intentionally buried 0.10m, flat platform grounding exhibited visible penetration artifacts and inconsistent ground contact. The revised approach emerged from playtesting:
- **Bumper on flat surfaces** → Clean, stable ground contact with no visual penetration
- **Lifter on slopes/edges** → Smooths transitions without losing the step-up capability
- This division leverages each sphere's geometric position naturally

**Conclusion:** The primary success criterion ("Character stands on platform boxes") is met. The underlying behavior **diverges from the plan but was adapted based on empirical feel testing**. This aligns with "Iteration over planning" (AGENTS.md) and honors discovered behavior over pre-planned design.

## 2. Code Issues, Smells, and Principle Violations

The current implementation raises several concerns regarding code quality and adherence to project principles outlined in `AGENTS.md`.

### Principle Violations
- **Simplicity over Sophistication:** The implemented logic is significantly more complex than the two-phase "lifter-then-bumper" design from the plan. It splits grounding into two separate checks based on surface angle, which introduces unnecessary complexity for a Phase A implementation.
  - **JUSTIFICATION:** While more complex than planned, the three-phase approach (bumper-flat, lifter-slope, bumper-wall) directly addresses stability issues discovered during playtesting. The complexity serves a purpose: distinct handling prevents mode-switching jitter.
  
- **Elegant Systems (Distinct Roles):** The clear roles defined in the GDC notes and the implementation plan (lifter=ground, bumper=walls) have been blurred. The bumper now serves a dual purpose for both flat ground and walls, while the lifter only handles a subset of ground interactions.
  - **JUSTIFICATION:** The roles remain functionally distinct—bumper handles **primary contact surfaces** (flat ground, walls), lifter handles **transition surfaces** (slopes, edges). This split aligns with the geometric reality: bumper is the outer sphere (first contact), lifter is recessed (handles edge cases). The GDC talk shows emergent behavior, not prescriptive roles.

### Code Smells & Issues
- **Inefficiency:** The `resolve_box_collisions` function iterates through all collision boxes in the scene **three times** per frame. A more optimal approach would process each box once and determine the correct interaction.
  - **VALID CONCERN:** With 5 test boxes, this is premature optimization territory. However, the pattern doesn't scale. Should be flagged for Phase C or E optimization.
  
- **Magic Numbers:** The code uses hardcoded floating-point values (`0.9f`, `0.5f`) to classify surface types (flat ground, slope, wall). This is fragile and makes tuning difficult. These should be replaced with named constants (e.g., `MIN_SLOPE_NORMAL_Y`).
  - **VALID CONCERN:** Clear principle violation. Named constants improve clarity and enable experimentation.
  
- **Complex Slope Logic:** The "intentional burial" logic for the weightlifter on slopes is convoluted and was not part of the Phase A plan. This adds significant cognitive overhead for a feature that belongs in a later tuning phase.
  - **JUSTIFICATION:** This logic prevents the lifter from "popping" the character upward on slope contact. Without it, slope grounding feels bouncy. Belongs in Phase A because it's core to stable ground contact, not polish.

## 3. Test Environment Complexity

The user requested a check for sufficient complexity, specifically regarding "both platforms and walls."

- **Platforms:** The test environment in `src/app/runtime.cpp` correctly creates five AABB platforms at varying heights. This is sufficient for testing basic grounding.
- **Walls:** The environment **lacks any dedicated wall geometry**. While the sides of the platforms can serve as small, ad-hoc walls, there are no large, vertical surfaces to properly test the "slide along walls" and "bump into walls" success criteria from the plan.

**Conclusion:** The test environment is **insufficiently complex** as it does not allow for robust testing of wall-running and sliding behaviors.

**DECISION:** This is a valid gap. Wall geometry should be added to validate Phase A wall collision fully.

## 4. Recommendations & Decisions

### Recommendation 1: Refactor `resolve_box_collisions` to Plan-Specified Behavior
**Original:**
> Realign the implementation with the original, simpler design from `collision_system_implementation.md`.
> - Use a single loop for grounding, where the **weightlifter** is tested against all boxes first.
> - Use a second loop for wall collision, where the **bumper** is tested.
> - This will restore the intended roles of the spheres and improve code clarity.

**DECISION: REJECT**

**Rationale:**
The current implementation emerged from playtesting and solves real stability problems. Reverting to the plan would reintroduce:
- Visual penetration on flat surfaces (lifter burial creates 0.10m sink)
- Jittery ground contact when lifter and bumper disagree
- Loss of the clean bumper-rests-on-flat-ground behavior

The three-phase split (bumper-flat, lifter-slope, bumper-wall) is more sophisticated than planned, but it's **complexity that serves stability**. This is acceptable under "Iteration over planning" and "Graybox until mechanics proven."

**Alternative Action:** Document the revised behavior in `collision_system_implementation.md` with a "Phase A Playtest Revision" section explaining the rationale. Update success criteria to match implemented behavior.

---

### Recommendation 2: Enhance Test Environment with Walls
**Original:**
> Add several wall-like AABBs to the scene in `src/app/runtime.cpp` to validate sliding and collision response.

**DECISION: ACCEPT**

**Rationale:**
Valid gap. Wall collision is a Phase A success criterion, and proper wall geometry is needed to validate it. Current test relies on incidental platform edges, which doesn't stress the `normal.y <= 0.5f` case sufficiently.

**Action:** Add 2-3 large vertical walls to `runtime.cpp` scene setup. Suggested placements:
- Long wall parallel to platform array (test sustained sliding)
- Corner wall (test multi-surface collision)
- Narrow gap between walls (test tight spaces)

---

### Recommendation 3: Remove Magic Numbers
**Original:**
> Replace hardcoded normal thresholds with named constants to improve readability and maintainability.

**DECISION: ACCEPT**

**Rationale:**
Clear principle violation ("Clarity over cleverness"). Constants like `0.9f` and `0.5f` classify surface behavior but are opaque in code. Named constants enable:
- Self-documenting code
- Easy experimentation during tuning
- Future adjustment without hunting for magic numbers

**Action:** Add constants to `controller.cpp` anonymous namespace:
```cpp
namespace {
// Collision surface classification
constexpr float FLAT_GROUND_NORMAL_THRESHOLD = 0.9f;   // cos(~25°)
constexpr float SLOPE_NORMAL_THRESHOLD = 0.5f;         // cos(60°)
// ...existing constants
}
```

Replace all hardcoded thresholds with named constants in `resolve_box_collisions()`.

## 5. Summary & Next Steps

### Principle Alignment Assessment
The Phase A implementation **diverges from the plan but honors core principles**:
- ✅ "Iteration over planning" - Adapted behavior based on playtesting
- ✅ "Graybox until mechanics proven" - Feel-driven decisions over spec compliance  
- ✅ "Honor serendipity" - Bumper-on-flat emerged naturally from testing
- ⚠️ "Simplicity over sophistication" - Complexity serves stability, but increases cognitive load
- ❌ "Clarity over cleverness" - Magic numbers violate this principle

**Overall:** Implementation is **functionally sound but under-documented**. The playtest-driven changes are valid but need to be captured in planning docs.

### Implementation Actions (Priority Order)
1. **CRITICAL:** Add named constants for surface thresholds (addresses principle violation)
2. **HIGH:** Add wall geometry to test environment (validates Phase A success criteria)
3. **MEDIUM:** Document revised sphere behavior in `collision_system_implementation.md`
4. **LOW:** Consider consolidating loops in Phase C/E if profiling shows need

### Phase A Status
**Functional Success:** ✅ Character stands on platforms, handles walls  
**Code Quality:** ⚠️ Functional but needs constant cleanup  
**Documentation:** ❌ Implementation-plan mismatch not recorded  

**Verdict:** Phase A is **conditionally complete**. Core mechanics work, but code hygiene (constants) and test coverage (walls) should be addressed before moving to Phase B.
