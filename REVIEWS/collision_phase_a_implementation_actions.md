# Phase A Review Implementation Actions

**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Purpose:** Document actions taken based on Phase A review recommendations

---

## Review Decisions Summary

### ✅ ACCEPTED: Named Constants for Surface Classification
**Problem:** Magic numbers (`0.9f`, `0.5f`) made collision logic opaque  
**Action:** Added constants to `controller.cpp`:
```cpp
constexpr float FLAT_GROUND_NORMAL_THRESHOLD = 0.9f; // cos(~25°) - bumper authority
constexpr float SLOPE_NORMAL_THRESHOLD = 0.5f;       // cos(60°) - lifter/wall boundary
constexpr float INTENDED_BURIAL_DEPTH = 0.10f;       // Target lifter penetration on slopes
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/character/controller.cpp` - Added constants, replaced all magic numbers

**Rationale:** Improves clarity, enables experimentation, aligns with "Clarity over cleverness"

---

### ✅ ACCEPTED: Wall Geometry for Test Environment
**Problem:** No dedicated wall geometry—only incidental platform edges  
**Action:** Added 5 wall AABBs to `runtime.cpp` scene setup:

1. **Long Wall** (6.0, 2.0, -10.0) - 8m long, tests sustained sliding
2. **Corner Wall 1** (-6.0, 1.5, -8.0) - 4m long, L-shape test part 1
3. **Corner Wall 2** (-4.0, 1.5, -12.0) - 4m wide, L-shape test part 2
4. **Gap Wall 1** (3.0, 1.0, 2.0) - Narrow gap test (1.8m apart)
5. **Gap Wall 2** (3.0, 1.0, 4.0) - Narrow gap test

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/runtime.cpp` - Added wall collision boxes

**Rationale:** Validates Phase A "slide along walls" success criterion properly

---

### ❌ REJECTED: Revert to Plan-Specified Lifter-First Grounding
**Problem:** Implementation uses bumper-flat/lifter-slope split, not lifter-first-always  
**Decision:** Keep current implementation  

**Rationale:**
The three-phase approach (bumper-flat, lifter-slope, bumper-wall) emerged from playtesting and solves critical stability issues:
- Bumper-on-flat → Clean ground contact, no visual penetration
- Lifter-on-slopes → Smooth transitions, handles edges naturally
- Reverting would reintroduce 0.10m burial artifacts on flat platforms

This aligns with core principles:
- ✅ "Iteration over planning" 
- ✅ "Graybox until mechanics proven"
- ✅ "Honor serendipity"

**Alternative Action Taken:**
- Updated review document with playtest justifications
- Next: Document revised behavior in implementation plan (tracked separately)

## Build Status
✅ All changes compile successfully  
✅ No errors or warnings introduced

## Next Steps (Not Yet Implemented)

### MEDIUM Priority: Update Implementation Plan
**File:** `PLANS/collision_system_implementation.md`  
**Action:** Add "Phase A Playtest Revision" section documenting:
- Bumper-flat/lifter-slope behavior split
- Rationale (stability, penetration artifacts)
- Revised success criteria matching actual implementation

### LOW Priority: Loop Optimization (Defer to Phase C/E)
The three-loop structure is inefficient but premature to optimize:
- Current: 5 collision boxes → 15 tests/frame
- Impact: Negligible at this scale
- Action: Profile if box count exceeds 50-100

## Principle Compliance Report

### Honored
✅ "Iteration over planning" - Accepted playtest-driven changes  
✅ "Clarity over cleverness" - Removed magic numbers  
✅ "Simple mechanics, emergent complexity" - Wall geometry tests natural interactions  

### Addressed
⚠️ Documentation gap - Review annotated, plan update pending  

### Outstanding
⚠️ "Simplicity over sophistication" - Three-phase logic more complex than planned, but serves stability

---

**Verdict:** Phase A is **conditionally complete** pending plan documentation update. Core mechanics validated, code hygiene improved, test coverage adequate.
